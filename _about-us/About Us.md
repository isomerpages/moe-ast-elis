The English Language Institute of Singapore (ELIS) was launched on 6 September 2011 by the first Prime Minister of Singapore, Mr Lee Kuan Yew.

ELIS aims to build the teacher leadership and pedagogical expertise of teachers of English Language (EL), Literature in English and General Paper. Aligned with this aim, ELIS offers a variety of teacher leadership and professional learning programmes and courses, as well as digital resources, to facilitate teacher learning and the growth of a vibrant learning community.

Our EL Pedagogy team supports EL teachers by enhancing their knowledge of subject content and pedagogy, including assessment and the use of ICT to teach EL. The team comprises Principal Master Teachers, Master Teachers and Academy Officers. 

  
Our Research and Effective Communication team of EL Specialists and Academy Officers works with teachers in schools to promote inquiry into their classroom practice. The team also offers courses that enable English-medium teachers to develop their students’ communication skills for learning.
