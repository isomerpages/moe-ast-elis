Before joining ELIS, Serene served as the Head of Department (English Language and Literature) in a secondary school. She counts it a privilege to have had the opportunity to work with teachers to improve the practice of English Language teaching in the classroom. A recipient of the MOE Post-Graduate Scholarship, she recently graduated with a Masters degree in Applied Linguistics and English Language Teaching. Her areas of interests include Teacher Education and Mentoring for English Language Teachers. She is keen to work with teachers to inspire learners with a love for the English Language.
