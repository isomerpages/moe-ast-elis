Prior to joining ELIS, Eunice taught English Language at the secondary level. Having studied linguistics at the National University of Singapore and University College London, Eunice is interested in the study of language as a meaning-making tool and believes in guiding students to develop appreciative and critical lenses in interpreting texts. She looks forward to engaging in conversations with fellow educators to make English lessons more engaging and effective.
