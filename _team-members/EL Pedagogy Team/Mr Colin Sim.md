He holds an Honours degree in Psychology & Theatre Studies from the National University of Singapore, and a MA in Leadership and Educational Change, a joint programme offered by NIE, Nanyang Technological University, and Teachers College, Columbia University.

He enjoys long hikes, good books and cooking for others.
