Benson joins ELIS from Fuhua Secondary School, where he was a Level Coordinator for English Language and Literature. Benson’s key interest is in preparing our students to navigate a constantly changing world. To this end, he is especially passionate about the English classroom as a place for exploring ethical issues, learning through dialogue, and multimodality in language and literature. Passionate about film studies, Benson has published on Hollywood musical films in _The Journal of Popular Culture_ and Singapore new wave horror cinema in _Asian Cinema_. Outside of education, Benson enjoys visiting temples and the mindfulness of weightlifting.
