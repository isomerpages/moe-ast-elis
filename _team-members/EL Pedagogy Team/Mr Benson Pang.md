Benson joins ELIS from&nbsp;Fuhua Secondary School, where he was a Level Coordinator for English Language and Literature. Bensonâ€™s key interest is in preparing our students to navigate a constantly changing world. To this end, he is especially passionate about the English classroom as a place for exploring ethical issues, learning through dialogue, and multimodality in language and literature. Passionate about film studies, Benson has published on Hollywood musical films in&nbsp;_The Journal of Popular Culture_&nbsp;and Singapore new wave horror cinema in&nbsp;_Asian Cinema_. Outside of education, Benson enjoys visiting temples and the mindfulness of weightlifting.
