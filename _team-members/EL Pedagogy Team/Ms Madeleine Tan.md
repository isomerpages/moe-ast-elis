Before joining ELIS, Madeleine was a cross-level deployed Subject Head of Assessment in a primary school. She began her teaching career in a secondary school where she taught English Language and Social Studies. She subsequently did a stint at MOE HR Recruitment Centre.

Madeleine is deeply passionate about assessment, specifically within the context of student development, literacy, and heuristics. She believes that deep learning often occurs beyond one's comfort zone and is interested in carving out creative spaces for learning. Outside of work, Madeleine enjoys making coffee (art) and experimenting with cooking recipes.
