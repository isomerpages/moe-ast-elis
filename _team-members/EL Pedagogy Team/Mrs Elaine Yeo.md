<h3><strong>Mrs Elaine Yeo</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Master Teacher</strong>
</p>
<p>Elaine started as a primary school teacher in 1992 and through the years
have held the portfolios of Head of Department of English, School Staff
Developer and Vice-Principal at various schools. She also spent 7 years
at the Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD) of the Ministry
of Education where she was a member of the team that pioneered the STELLAR
programme in Singapore primary schools. Prior to becoming a Master Teacher,
Elaine was Deputy Director/Pedagogy at ELIS. Being involved in the work
of ELIS made her decide to return to her first love – teaching.</p>
<p>A teacher at heart, Elaine’s passion is to see students be empowered to
take ownership of their own learning and enjoy their education experience.
Currently a school-based Master Teacher, she is invigorated by the opportunities
to inspire teachers to not only improve their craft, but also to find the
joy of teaching. When not working, Elaine likes reading, listening to music,
travelling and trying out new cuisines (though not necessarily in that
order!).</p>
