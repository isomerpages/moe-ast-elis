Florence taught English Language and Literature in English at both the lower and upper secondary levels, and General Paper, Project Work, and Knowledge and Inquiry at a junior college before joining ELIS. She also has experience working on syllabus reviews and implementation support during her stint with CPDD/MOE. Florence has a Master of Arts in Applied Linguistics from the National University of Singapore and a Doctor of Education in Adult Learning and Leadership from Teachers College, Columbia University. Florence hopes to deepen her appreciation of the different ways teachers as adult learners learn and how she can support teacher learning and growth.
