<h4><strong>Mr Kenneth Yee</strong></h4>
<p><strong>Academy Officer, Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p>Kenneth is an Academy Officer at ELIS and has taught English Language
and English Literature at the secondary level for seven years. He is a
passionate advocate for experiencing the world through story. Kenneth is
convinced of the value and the need for young learners to engage with literary
fiction and poetry to become more empathetic and global citizens. He enjoys
spurring students to have deeper and more thoughtful discussions about
the texts they read to help them better connect with and understand the
world they live in.</p>
<p>In his free time, Kenneth immerses himself in shoegaze and instrumental
music, and is drawn to evocative artwork on vinyl record sleeves.</p>
