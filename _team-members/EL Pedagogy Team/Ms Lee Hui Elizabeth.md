Before joining ELIS, Elizabeth&nbsp;was Subject Head of English in a secondary school where she taught English Language and Literature at upper secondary levels.&nbsp;Elizabeth believes that a key aspect in learning is engagement and that students should be allowed to experience and explore independently to gain skills that are necessary for both assessment and use in todayâ€™s VUCA world. She is interested in exploring the use of alternative assessments and harnessing the power of multiliteracy skills and technology to enrich both teaching and learning.&nbsp;She enjoys cardio sessions at the gym, rock climbing and travelling.
