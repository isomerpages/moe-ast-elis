<h4><strong>Ms Cindy Woon</strong></h4>
<p>Prior to joining ELIS, Cindy served as Level Head (English) in a primary
school. She embraces the philosophy of learning, unlearning and relearning.
Her growth mindset and insatiable curiosity led her to pursue a Master
of Arts in Literary Studies at National University of Singapore. Cindy
looks forward to exploring innovative approaches and collaborating with
fellow educators to enhance the teaching and learning of the English language.
In her leisure time, she enjoys playing the piano and discovering new interests.</p>
