Jennifer has more than 20 years of teaching experience in primary and secondary schools. She joined the Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD), MOE in 2007. During her stint there, she was involved in writing unit guidelines for the STELLAR programme, the development of STELLAR teacher-training packages and the conducting of STELLAR workshops for primary school teachers. She also facilitated the training sessions for STELLAR Teacher Mentors (STMs). She finds it rewarding to work directly with teachers in effectively delivering the curriculum and providing their pupils with the content knowledge and experiences to help them face the challenges of the 21st Century. Her passion is to support teachers who are helping struggling learners acquire good language skills to become effective communicators.
