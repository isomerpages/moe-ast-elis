Prior to joining AST, Jeanne was with the Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice (CRPP) in NIE for about six years. Jeanne believes that teachers need to continually develop their pedagogical competency so that they can adapt their teaching based on their students’ evolving needs. Jeanne tries to exercise at least five days a week by playing badminton and jogging at a nearby park.
