<p>In this episode, we feature Sally Ann Jones, Senior Lecturer with the
English Language and Literature Department of the National Institute of
Education, Renee Yuanna Sulaiman, Senior Teacher of English Language at
Punggol Primary School, and Andre Wong, Teacher of English Language at
Pasir Ris Crest Secondary School. Sally, Renee and Andre speak with Cedric
Leong, Principal Master Teacher, about Metacognition as a pedagogical emphasis
of the English Language Syllabus 2020. They explore the characteristics
of classrooms that emphasise metacognition, the teacher's role in building
metacognitive awareness, and practical strategies for fostering a culture
of metacognition in English Language teaching, learning and assessment.&nbsp;</p>
