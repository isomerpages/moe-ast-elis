<p>In this episode, we feature Christine Goh, NTU President's Chair Professor
in Education, English Language and Literature Department, National Institute
of Education, NTU; Margaret Teo, Senior Teacher of English Language at
Pei Hwa Presbyterian Primary School; and Colin Sim, Head of Department
for English Language and Literature at Yusof Ishak Secondary School. Christine,
Margaret and Colin explore with Cedric Leong, Principal Master Teacher,
the question: “Is metacognition more than reflection?”. They discuss how
metacognitive processing can be encouraged and made audible and visible
in the pre-, while-, and post-phases of lessons in the English Language
classroom. They also explore practical approaches and strategies for building
the metacognitive ability of students as they perform language tasks in
the various areas of language learning, and how these can be supported
and enhanced through the use EdTech and AI.</p>
