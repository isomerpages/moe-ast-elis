In this first episode, Dr Paul Doyle, Deputy Director, Research, talks about the use of singular and plural nouns, and countable and uncountable nouns.

Grammar Matters is a podcast series which aims to create more awareness of areas of English language use in Singapore that differ from standard English. The series is based on the ‘[Grammar Matters](https://www.relc.org.sg/facilities/resources/publications)’ booklets by SEAMEO RELC.
