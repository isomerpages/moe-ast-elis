Curious about conducting classroom inquiry?   
  
We feature EL teacher Mrs Adeline Teo, who talks about the teaching and learning problem that moved her and her colleagues, Mdm Koh Ting Ting and Mdm Irene Leong, to action.  This is the first of a 4-part series about their classroom inquiry project.    
  
In this episode Adeline talks about how she and her team started on their inquiry project: what motivated them, what research literature they looked at, what their research question was, and how they designed a pedagogical intervention to address their research question.
