In this episode, English Language teacher, Mrs Adeline Teo, talks about what motivated her team to start on a classroom inquiry. She describes the research literature the team referred to, the research question they came up with, and how they designed a pedagogical intervention to address their research question.

The ‘Developing Motivation to Write through Journalling’ episodes focus on a classroom inquiry project by Mrs Adeline Teo, Mdm Koh Ting Ting and Mdm Irene Leong from De La Salle Primary School. They completed their classroom inquiry project on the use of journalling to motivate reluctant writers in a primary school with support from ELIS in 2016.
