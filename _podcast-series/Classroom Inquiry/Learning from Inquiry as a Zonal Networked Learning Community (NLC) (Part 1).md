In this episode, four Teacher Leaders, Mdm Nora Misnari, Mr Peter Chutatape, Mdm Sanmuga Malar and Mdm Yusnita Mohamed Taib, recount how they started a classroom inquiry by identifying the learning needs of teacher colleagues and their students.

In conversation with Dr Alison Tan, a Lead Specialist from ELIS, the Teacher Leaders talk about classroom inquiry as a means to grow teacher leaders’ competencies in guiding and mentoring EL teachers, and improving EL Teaching and Learning practices in West Zone Schools.

The ‘Learning from Inquiry as a Zonal Networked Learning Community’ episodes feature Mdm Nora Misnari, English Language Senior Teacher from Unity Primary School, and Mr Peter Chutatape, Mdm Sanmuga Malar and Mdm Yusnita Mohamed Taib, English Language Lead Teachers from Bukit Panjang Primary School, Princess Elizabeth Primary School and West Grove Primary School respectively. With eight other colleagues from their Networked Learning Community, they completed two classroom inquiry projects with support from ELIS in 2021.
