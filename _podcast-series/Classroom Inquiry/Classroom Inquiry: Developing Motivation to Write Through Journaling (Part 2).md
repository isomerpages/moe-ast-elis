Curious about conducting classroom inquiry?   
This is the second of a 4-part series about Mrs Adeline Lynn Teo, Mdm Koh Ting Ting and Mdm Irene Leong's classroom inquiry project.     
   
In this episode Adeline talks about how her team selected their participants and what data they collected in order to answer their research question: What is the effect of guided journaling on reluctant writers' attitude towards writing?
