In this episode, English Language teacher Mrs Adeline Teo talks about how her team selected participants and collected data to answer their research question: What is the effect of guided journaling on reluctant writers’ attitudes towards writing?

The ‘Developing Motivation to Write through Journalling’ episodes focus on a classroom inquiry project by Mrs Adeline Teo, Mdm Koh Ting Ting and Mdm Irene Leong from De La Salle Primary School. They completed their classroom inquiry project on the use of journalling to motivate reluctant writers in a primary school with support from ELIS in 2016.
