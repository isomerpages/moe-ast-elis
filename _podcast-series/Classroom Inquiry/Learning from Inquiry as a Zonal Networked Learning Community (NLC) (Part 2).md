This three-part episode features Nora Misnari, an English Language Senior Teacher from Unity Primary School, Peter Chutatape, an English Language Lead Teacher from Bukit Panjang Primary School, Sanmuga Malar, an English Language Lead Teacher from Princess Elizabeth Primary School, and Yusnita Mohamed Taib, an English Language Lead Teacher from West Grove Primary School. Together with eight other colleagues from the Networked Learning Community (NLC), they completed two classroom inquiry projects in 2021, with support from ELIS.&nbsp;

They talk with Dr Alison Tan, a Lead Specialist from ELIS, about their classroom inquiry projects to grow West Zone teacher leadersâ€™ competencies in guiding and mentoring West Zone EL teachers and improving EL Teaching and Learning practices in West Zone Schools.

In this second episode, two teacher leaders, Peter and Malar, will share more about their inquiry in the area of oracy, their findings and insights on the impact of the inquiry on their own learning and practice.
