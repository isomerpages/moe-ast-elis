In this episode, two Teacher Leaders, Mr Peter Chutatape and Mdm Sanmuga Malar, reflect on their classroom inquiry which looked into the teaching of oracy. They discuss their insights into the effect of teachers using talk moves during classroom discussions.

In discussion with Dr Alison Tan, a Lead Specialist from ELIS, the teacher leaders talk about classroom inquiry as a means to grow teacher leaders’ competencies in guiding and mentoring EL teachers, and improving EL Teaching and Learning practices in West Zone Schools.
