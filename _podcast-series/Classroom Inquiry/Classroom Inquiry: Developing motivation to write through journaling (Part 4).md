In this episode, English Language teacher, Mrs Adeline Teo, talks about how her team communicated their classroom inquiry findings, and shares some advice and tips for teachers. 

The ‘Developing Motivation to Write through Journalling’ episodes focus on a classroom inquiry project by Mrs Adeline Teo, Mdm Koh Ting Ting and Mdm Irene Leong from De La Salle Primary School. They completed their classroom inquiry project on the use of journalling to motivate reluctant writers in a primary school with support from ELIS in 2016.
