In this episode, two Teacher Leaders, Mdm Nora Misnari and Mdm Yusnita Mohamed Taib, reflect on their classroom inquiry which looked into the teaching of reading and viewing. They discuss the data they collected on the effects of reading strategy instruction on students and describe the impact of the classroom inquiry on their learning and practice.

In conversation with Dr Alison Tan, a Lead Specialist from ELIS, the teacher leaders talk about classroom inquiry as a means to grow teacher leaders’ competencies in guiding and mentoring EL teachers and improving EL Teaching and Learning practices in West Zone Schools.

The “Learning from Inquiry as a Zonal Networked Learning Community” episodes feature Mdm Nora Misnari, English Language Senior Teacher from Unity Primary School, and Mr Peter Chutatape, Mdm Sanmuga Malar and Mdm Yusnita Mohamed Taib, English Language Lead Teachers from Bukit Panjang Primary School, Princess Elizabeth Primary School and West Grove Primary School respectively.
