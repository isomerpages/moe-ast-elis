<p>The podcast episodes in the area of Inquiry through Dialogue (ItD) offer
a range of perspectives on why ItD is important for student learning, what
ItD looks like in enactment and how it can be enacted in classrooms.&nbsp;</p>

Paper; Tina Sajnani, Lead Teacher/Literature; and Edwin Pang, Senior Teacher/English
Language. They are passionate teacher practitioners of ItD in their classrooms.
