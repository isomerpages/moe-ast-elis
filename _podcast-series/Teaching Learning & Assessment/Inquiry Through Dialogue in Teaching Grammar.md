<p>The podcast episodes in the area of Inquiry through Dialogue (ItD) offer
a range of perspectives on why ItD is important for student learning, what
ItD looks like in enactment and how it can be enacted in classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode, we feature Melody Heng, Teacher/English Language, and
Jerome Lim, Subject Head/Literature. They are teachers who keenly practise
ItD in their classrooms. Melody and Jerome speak with Tay May Yin, Principal
Master Teacher, about their classroom enactment of ItD in the teaching
and learning of grammar, and its impact on their studentsâ€™ learning and
language use.</p>
