<p>The podcast episodes in the area of Inquiry through Dialogue (ItD) offer
a range of perspectives on why ItD is important for student learning, what
ItD looks like in enactment and how it can be enacted in classrooms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this episode, we feature James Koh, Master Teacher and Stephanie Hua,
Head of Department. They are Teacher Leaders who are deeply interested
in the practice of ItD in their classrooms. James and Stephanie speak with
Tay May Yin, Principal Master Teacher about why they value ItD, how they
enact ItD in their lessons, and the impact ItD has on their students’ learning.&nbsp;
