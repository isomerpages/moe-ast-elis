<p>The Professional Learning Programmes (PLPs) are designed to enable teachers
to deepen their knowledge, skills and classroom practice in the areas of
language learning. Teachers can also learn how their application of e-pedagogy
and blended learning can be guided by sound understanding of the principles
and processes of English Language teaching and learning.</p>

<p>Overview and Programme Structure</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As Key Personnel and Teacher Leaders of the EL department of a school,
you will co-decide and co-select the shared learning focus for your department
from ELIS’s suite of flagship PLPs@School. PLPs@School are designed to
enable all in your EL department to teach EL more effectively. You will
co-lead your department in applying the learning and inquiring into classroom
application.

<br>There are three areas of support your EL department can look forward to
from a Master Teacher/EL (MTT/EL):</p>
