The Professional Learning Programmes (PLPs) are designed to enable teachers to deepen their knowledge, skills and classroom practice in the areas of language learning. Teachers can also learn how their application of e-pedagogy and blended learning can be guided by sound understanding of the principles and processes of English Language teaching and learning.

<p>As Key Personnel and Teacher Leaders of the English Language (EL) department of a school, you will co-decide and co-select the shared learning focus for your department from ELIS’s suite of flagship PLPs@School. PLPs@School are designed to enable all in your EL department to teach EL more effectively. You will co-lead your department in applying the learning and inquiring into classroom application.</p>
			<p>There are three areas of support your EL department can look forward to from a Master Teacher/EL (MTT/EL):</p>
