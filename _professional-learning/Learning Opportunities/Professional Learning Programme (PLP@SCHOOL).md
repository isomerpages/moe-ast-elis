The Professional Learning Programmes (PLPs) are designed to enable teachers to deepen their knowledge, skills and classroom practice in the areas of language learning. Teachers can also learn how their application of e-pedagogy and blended learning can be guided by sound understanding of the principles and processes of English Language teaching and learning.
