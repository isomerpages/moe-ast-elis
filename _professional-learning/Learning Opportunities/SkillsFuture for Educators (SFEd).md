The SFEd Differentiated Instruction courses enable English Language teachers to better respond to variation in studentsâ€™ learning readiness, interests and learning profiles. The SFEd Inquiry-Based Learning courses enable teachers to guide students in exploring, coconstructing and inquiring into ideas and issues, and engaging in metacognitive learning processes.
