The grammar courses are designed to enable English Language teachers to attain clearer understanding of English grammar and apply this understanding to teach grammar more accurately and effectively to their students.  
  
As the ability to distinguish between word classes is foundational to building knowledge about English grammar, teachers may consider registering for the course on Word Classes before participating in the other grammar courses.
