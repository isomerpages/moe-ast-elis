<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>As KP and TLs of the EL department of a school, you will co-decide and
co-select the shared learning focus for your department from ELIS’s flagship
PLPs@School. PLPs@School are designed to enable all in your EL department
to build the knowledge bases to address the diverse needs of learners in
EL classrooms. You will co-lead your department in applying the learning
and inquiring into classroom application.</p>
<p>Your EL department can look forward to three areas of support from an
MTT/EL:</p>

<p>Your EL department will choose&nbsp;<strong><u>one</u></strong>&nbsp;of
the following areas of language learning,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Teaching Oracy (Primary/Secondary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching Reading and Viewing (Primary/Secondary)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Teaching Writing and Representing (Primary/Secondary) &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>For any area of language learning that you select, your EL department
members will deepen their knowledge bases to address the diverse needs
of learners in EL classrooms. They will also consider ways of using EdTech,
including AI, in blended learning contexts to support active learning in
the selected area, and&nbsp;in integration with the other areas of language
learning.</p>
<p>You can refer to pages 20 to 25&nbsp;for the details on the areas of language
learning listed above.</p>
