<p>SWI is a ten-day professional learning opportunity for EL KP, TLs and
potential KP/TLs in primary and secondary schools to experience writing
as writers, so that they can become more effective teachers of writing
and representing. Modelled on the Invitational Summer Writing Institute
of the National Writing Project in the USA, SWI offers the support of the
Singapore Writing Project team for its participants to undertake an inquiry,
spanning one and a half years, into what writing involves, how to effectively
support the writing of students as writers, and how to lead others in learning
about writing and representing.</p>
