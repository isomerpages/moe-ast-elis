<p>The Literature Subject Chapter (LSC) was formed in 2021. The LSC comprises
eight Teacher Leaders (TLs) of Literature from the four zones. The objectives
of the LSC are for the TLs to:</p>
<p>• grow their own and other TLs’/teachers’ pedagogical competencies and
leadership for the teaching, learning and assessment of Literature;</p>
<p>• collaborate and promote the collaboration of other TLs/teachers in Networked
Learning Communities (NLCs) in order to learn and critically inquire into
ways of effectively supporting students in the teaching, learning and assessment
of Literature; and</p>
<p>• co-build a teacher-led culture of professionalism to lead other TLs/teachers
in NLCs in the teaching, learning and assessment of Literature.</p>
<p>The TLs are supported by a Principal Master Teacher and a Master Teacher
from ELIS and two Knowledgeable Others – a Senior Specialist from the Ministry
of Education’s Curriculum Planning and Development Division and an Associate
Professor from the National Institute of Education.</p>
