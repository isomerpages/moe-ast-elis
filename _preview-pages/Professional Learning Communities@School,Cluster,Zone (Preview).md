<p>ELIS’s PLPs@School are designed for the Key Personnel (KP), Teacher Leaders
(TLs) and teachers in the EL Department of their school to deepen their
knowledge, skills and classroom practice in a selected area of language
learning. Supported by a Master Teacher, they also learn how their application
of e-Pedagogy and Blended Learning in the area of language learning can
be guided by sound understanding of the principles and processes of EL
teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The Master Teacher facilitating a PLP@School guides the EL KP, TLs and
teachers in their Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) through cycles of
learning, application, review and reflection over a year.&nbsp;In that
time, the Master Teacher also co-plans, co-teaches and co-reviews selected
lessons with PLT members, and provides guidance for the growth of teacher
leadership among them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ZNS is an annual opportunity for EL Lead Teachers (LTs) from primary
and secondary schools to network with one another and with Master Teachers
from ELIS. Together, they co-construct and clarify their understanding
about selected areas of inquiry in EL teaching, learning and assessment.
In the last few years, the learning focus of the ZNS include e-Pedagogy
and Blended Learning, and the Pedagogical Emphases of EL Syllabus 2020.</p>

Communities at the cluster or zonal levels, in which the LTs can further
their inquiries into their selected areas of learning with the support
of Master Teachers from ELIS.</p>

from ELIS support the EL LTs in these PLCs@Zone to grow in their pedagogical
leadership so that they can lead/co-lead Networked Learning Communities
(NLCs) more effectively. &nbsp;</p>
