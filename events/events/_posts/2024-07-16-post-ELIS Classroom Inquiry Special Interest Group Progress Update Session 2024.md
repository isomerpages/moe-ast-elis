<p>At the session, members from three schools provided updates on their ongoing
inquiry projects and sought feedback from the others. All the inquiry projects
had a common focus on leveraging AI to support students’ learning. Pasir
Ris Secondary School and NUS High School are exploring the use of AI to
support students’ writing while Tanjong Katong Primary School is exploring
the use of AI to support students in generating ideas for their stimulus-based
conversations.</p>

<p>The members will meet up with their respective ELIS Specialists to receive
