### Advancing Communication: Technology, Inquiry and Implementation Platforms

Schools on the WSA-EC programme attended the 5th Annual WSA-EC Forum at the Academy of Singapore Teachers on 29 October 2018. The theme for this year’s forum was Advancing Communication: Technology, Inquiry and Implementation Platforms. Professor Agnes Kukulska-Hulme, Professor of Learning Technology and Communication at the Institute of Educational Technology, Open University UK, delivered the keynote address on the potential of online and mobile learning across the curriculum.

EC Champions then engaged in learning at sharing sessions from four WSA-EC schools, which presented how they had implemented school wide programmes to develop the subject literacy and communication skills of their students. EC Champions from EL departments were able to hear presentations of findings by EL teachers who had inquired into their classroom practices on projects funded by ELIS.
