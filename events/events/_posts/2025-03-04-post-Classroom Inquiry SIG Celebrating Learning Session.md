<p>Members of the ELIS Classroom Inquiry Special Interest Group (SIG) gathered
in-person on Thursday 20 Feb 2025 to celebrate the completion of their
inquiry projects and their learning from engaging in classroom inquiry.
Four teams presented their studies which yielded encouraging learning outcomes
for the teachers and students involved.</p>
<p>Participants relished the opportunity to hear about their colleagueâ€™s
collaborative projects and their findings. During the lively Q &amp; A
segment following each presentation, participants clarified learning points
and exchanged ideas for effective teaching.</p>
<p>After the presentations, participants gathered in groups to network and
explore ideas for their next classroom inquiry projects. Members who expressed
interest to engage in classroom inquiry will receive support from the ELIS
Specialists and their SIG peers. The SIG will meet again later in the year
for a Progress Update session.</p>
