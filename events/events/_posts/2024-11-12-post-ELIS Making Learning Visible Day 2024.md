<p>How might we understand our learners' needs before designing learning
experiences? How could we apply Design Thinking processes to frame constraints
as opportunities in the generation of new ideas and approaches?</p>
<p>This year, ELIS benefitted from the expertise of Dr Wong Yew Leong, Lecturer
with the Policy, Curriculum and Leadership Academic Department in the National
Institute of Education, as a knowledgeable other in our learning about
Design Thinking processes.</p>
<p>The interactions facilitated by Dr Wong prompted reflection on how we
could co-review and co-design our learning programmes and courses to address
teacher learnersâ€™ needs more effectively. Our reflections as facilitators
of learning drove home to us the primary importance of stepping into the
shoes of learners.</p>
<p>At the ELIS Making Learning Visible Day on 12 November 2024, we explored
the use of a fishbowl conversation to listen to and discuss one another's
learning from applying Design Thinking principles and processes in our
inquiry projects.</p>
