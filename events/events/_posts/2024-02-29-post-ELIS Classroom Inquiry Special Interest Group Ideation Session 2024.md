<p>At the Ideation Session, the SIG members took turns to talk about their
areas of inquiry and asked for feedback on their inquiry questions and
plans. They discussed the following areas of inquiry:</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Examining the effect of freewriting
on students’ motivation towards writing</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Looking into ways to support reluctant
readers</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exploring technology-enabled tools
to promote metacognitive thinking</p>
<p>·&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Using LangFA to develop students'
metacognition through feedback</p>
<p>Following the Ideation Session, the SIG members will work with ELIS Specialists
to refine and carry out their inquiry plans.</p>
