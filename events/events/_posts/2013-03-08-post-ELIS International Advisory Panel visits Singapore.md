We welcomed our International Advisory Panel (IAP) members - Professor Ronald Carter (University of Nottingham), Professor Christine Davison (University of New South Wales) and Professor Amy Tsui (University of Hong Kong) who visited Singapore between 6 and 8 March 2013.

Besides meeting with senior officers from the MOE, the IAP members also visited Bedok Green Primary School and Tanjong Katong Girls’ School. The panel members also visited the English Language and Literature Academic Group, the Office of Education Research (OER) and the Centre for Research in Pedagogy and Practice (CRPP) at NIE. The IAP members had the opportunity to interact with school leaders and teachers, especially to find out more about EL pedagogy and effective communication in Singapore schools.

On 8 March, ELIS hosted the IAP Symposium, a half-day session, where the IAP panel members each gave a presentation based on the theme ‘Scaffolding for Student Learning’. The invited guests who attended the symposium included school leaders and representatives from WSA-EC schools, as well as ELIS Affiliates who had been actively involved with us. In addition to members of the ELIS Council, academic staff from our key partners, NIE and NUS, were also present.

The ELIS team is delighted to have the opportunity to interact with and learn from such an esteemed Panel. We look forward to being able to apply what we have learnt from the IAP.
