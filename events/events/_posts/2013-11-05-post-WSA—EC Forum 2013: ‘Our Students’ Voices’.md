Schools on the WSA-EC programme attended the annual WSA-EC Forum at the Academy of Singapore Teachers on 5 November 2013. Dr Anneliese Kramer-Dahl, an ELIS Research Consultant, and Dr Paul Doyle, Programme Director, Effective Communication, ELIS, delivered the plenary address. They highlighted the importance of talk for learning, the need for teachers to model subject literacy through classroom interactions and the value of scaffolding the development of our students’ academic ‘voices’. As well as being vital in helping subject teachers meet the objectives of their subject syllabuses, engaging students in dialogue and discussion is part of a broader 21st century communication skills repertoire.

The teachers then engaged in learning at sharing sessions conducted by WSA-EC schools, and ELIS’s partners from the National Institute of Singapore (NIE), the Curriculum Planning and Development Division (CPDD) and The British Council in various concurrent sessions.
