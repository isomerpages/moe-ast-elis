Farrell, T. S., & Lim, P. C. P. (2005). Conceptions of grammar teaching: A case study of teachers’ beliefs and classroom practices. TESL-EJ, 9(2), 1-13.

### Background

Despite a growing interest in the area of teachers’ beliefs, little is known about the beliefs of experienced language teachers, particularly in the Singapore primary school context. In addition, there seems to be conflicting evidence about the correlation between teachers’ reported beliefs and their actual classroom practices in grammar teaching.

### Aims

The authors aimed to explore experienced English language teachers’ beliefs about the way grammar should be taught in primary schools, and to investigate their actual classroom practices of teaching grammar. In doing so, the authors sought to gain a better understanding of the relationship between beliefs and actual classroom practices with regard to teaching grammar.

### Sample

This study involved two experienced English language primary school teachers.

### Method

A qualitative case study approach was adopted. Apart from pre- and post-lesson interviews, the authors also conducted non-participatory observations of the teachers’ classes. Random samples of their students’ written work were also collected and analysed. Data collected from both teachers and students were matched for convergence and divergence between beliefs and practices.

### Findings

Results revealed that the teachers possessed a set of complex beliefs that were sometimes not reflected in their classroom practices. Both teachers were found to adopt a more traditional overt approach to grammar teaching which resulted in lessons that were mainly teacher-centred and worksheet-based. As observed, both teachers were prone to provide explanations and instructions, ask questions, and elicit responses from the students on their knowledge of grammar items.

In the case of one teacher-participant, her actual classroom practices of providing explicit instruction were found to be congruent with her beliefs that overt grammar teaching was beneficial to her students’ learning. For the other teacher-participant, however, the authors noted a divergence between her stated beliefs and her actual classroom practices. Despite having indicated her preference for a more indirect, or covert approach to grammar teaching, she was more inclined to provide explicit grammar instruction. The activities she planned were also not successfully contextualised into meaningful communicative situations. Findings also suggested that factors such as time and teachers’ reverence for traditional grammar instruction may also influence teachers’ actual instructional practices.

### Implications

The authors raised the importance of providing language teachers with opportunities to reflect on and examine their own beliefs about teaching grammar. It is also helpful if teachers are encouraged to investigate any discrepancies between their personal beliefs and their actual instructional practices.
