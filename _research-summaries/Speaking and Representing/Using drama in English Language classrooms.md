Stinson, M. (2009). 'Drama is like reversing everything': Intervention research as teacher professional development. _Research in Drama Education: The Journal of Applied Theatre and Performance, 14_(2), 225-243.

### Background

The researchers in the team were invited by the principal of the participating school to conduct professional development in the use of drama in English language classrooms after having seen the impact of process drama workshops on the oral communication results of Secondary 4 students in nation-wide examinations.

### Aims

The objective of this study was to study the impact of drama on oral communication in secondary schools in Singapore.

### Sample

Eight English language teachers and 12 Secondary 1 and 2 classes participated in this study.

### Method

The research team used a professional development model that drew on models of co-planning and co-teaching, and the coaching-mentoring model of theory-observation/demonstration-practice-feedback and follow-up with significant emphasis on mentoring to provide ongoing professional support. They conducted workshops to give the teachers some basic knowledge about drama conventions and strategies which included still images, teacher-in-role, and pair and small-group role-play. The teachers worked alongside the researchers as co-teachers, or observers while the researchers taught the students. All professional development sessions and co-planning sessions were audio-recorded. Two classes led by the intervention school teachers were video-recorded. Think-aloud reflections on the teachers' responses to the lessons that they planned and enacted were video-recorded.

### Findings

The teachers reported more student engagement in classes where drama was incorporated. The class was more student-centred rather than teacher-centred and the practice moved away from direct teaching and worksheets. There was a shift from written to oral communication. Teacher interview data showed that students:

1.  Explored many perspectives of a person's story;
2.  Analysed the characters better with the use of drama conventions;
3.  Had better content and showed more imagination in their writing;
4.  Used better language and vocabulary in their writing;
5.  Spoke English more frequently to each other;
6.  Participated more and were more responsive; and
7.  Volunteered responses.

### Implications

Teachers could use drama strategies in the classroom for better student engagement and more practice of oral communication.
