Wood, K. D., Vintinner, J., Hill-Miller, P., Harmon, J., & Hedrick, W. (2009). An investigation of teachers’ concerns about vocabulary and the representation of these concerns in content literacy methodology textbooks. Reading Psychology, 30, 319-339. doi: 10.1080/02702710802411562

### Background

The authors stated that the underlying knowledge base of effective vocabulary teaching and learning includes the extensive body of research on vocabulary acquisition. The area of vocabulary at the middle and secondary level is strongly embedded in the teaching and learning that occurs in content area classrooms. For this reason, the major issues that surround the infusion of literacy instruction with content instruction also apply to vocabulary.

### Aims

The aim of the study was to:

*   find out what questions currently practicing middle grade teachers have about vocabulary instruction; and
*   determine what current undergraduate content area textbooks provide answers to these vocabulary questions.

### Sample

A total of 390 middle school teachers completed the online survey. For the content area analysis of textbooks, three top-selling content area textbooks were analysed.

### Method

In the first stage of the study, a survey was administered to the teachers. In the second stage of the study, three top-selling content area textbooks were examined to identify the frequency and quality of references to vocabulary instruction.

### Findings

The findings identified the top five questions deemed important to middle school teachers, which were:

*   How do I motivate students to learn new words?
*   How do I provide multiple exposures to help students internalize word meaning?
*   How do I help students understand how wide reading impacts their vocabulary knowledge?
*   How do I teach context clues so the students will use this strategy independently?
*   How do I teach students to self-select words they need to learn?

The authors identified much variation in the way vocabulary instruction was presented across the top three content area textbooks. Analyses of the textbooks yielded the following findings addressing the top five questions:

*   Motivation: The texts identified covered motivation in detail including citations with strategies and examples.
*   Multiple exposure: There was little attention given in all three textbooks.
*   Wide reading: Wide reading received the least attention in all the textbooks.
*   Context clues: Context clues received the most attention across all three textbooks.
*   Self-selection: Two examples and nine references to specific strategies for self-selection were provided in the textbooks.  
    

### Implications

The authors suggest there is a need to open the dialogue between researchers and classroom teachers as a means of mutually sharing our knowledge of research and instruction. The researchers also propose that teachers are provided with continuous training on vocabulary knowledge.
