Faltis, C., Arias, M. B., & Ramírez-Marín, F. (2010). Identifying relevant competencies for secondary teachers of English learners.Bilingual Research Journal, 33(3), 307-328, doi: 10.1080/15235882.2010.529350

### Background

The writers believed the literature suggested areas all teachers with English learners (students from non-English speaking homes) in their classes needed to know about. However, they felt there was little about the knowledge specifically needed by every secondary teacher with English learners in their classes.

### Aims

The purpose of the study was to identify knowledge and practices important for all teachers of English learners, those important for secondary teachers with English learners and, finally, areas the teachers thought important.

### Sample

The authors studied the literature to find the knowledge and practices required by all teachers with English learners and those required by any secondary teacher with English learners in their classes. They analysed 40 replies to a survey of secondary teachers of English learners.

### Method

Based on the literature, the authors prepared a survey of secondary teachers. The survey included five questions each on Language and Language Learning, and Multiple Assessments and Language Standards and six questions each on Students’ Backgrounds and Communities, and the Social, Cultural, and Political Dimensions of Language.

### Findings

The analysis suggested that all teachers with English learners in their classes needed to understand that learning the language of content subjects took time. It detailed nine competencies for all teachers of English learners and the need for all to understand the use of language learning strategies and integrate their use into subject content.  
  
The literature reported six categories of recommended teacher competencies for secondary teachers of English learners. They also needed to understand the importance of practising the language of their particular subject area. It was recommended that content be presented thematically providing a regular review of language learnt and start from the prior knowledge of students. The use of small groups of mixed ability (English learners with English speakers) was essential.   
  
The teachers responding to the survey believed all teachers must understand the difference between social and academic language and how language learning strategies could help English learners.

### Implications

The researchers concluded that secondary teachers with English learners in their classes needed to understand the differences between social and academic language, value the students’ primary language, and be able to use a variety of assessments.   
  
The researchers recommended future research use focus group discussions of secondary teachers with English learners in their class. There was also a real need for research into what these teachers actually did to help their students.
