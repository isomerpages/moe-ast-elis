### Background

According to the author, the varying demographics of the teaching and teacher education force, the varying student populations, and the changing nature of literacy suggested the challenge of determining the essential pedagogical knowledge a teacher needed to teach tomorrow’s children.

### Aims

The author proposed rethinking teacher education, using literacy teaching as an example, and taking into consideration the challenges experienced by teachers concerning their knowledge and practice.

### Sample

The author made her recommendations for future teacher education based on several longitudinal studies of the literacy development of children growing up and schooling in poor communities in Australia.

### Method

The author observed teaching practices that had a positive impact on the children’s literacy learning. She then synthesized these studies and classified the practices into five categories-interpretive work, pedagogical work, discursive work, relational work and institutional work.

### Findings

The author concluded that teachers who made a significant impact on children’s literacy learning took an interpretive stance where they would observe the children, their products and performances closely whenever these children were engaged in various tasks. They were responsive to the children’s actions and offered feedback to them at appropriate times. They were also highly analytical and diagnostic about their students’ learning progress and difficulties. These teachers possessed focus and strong pedagogical knowledge of their subject. After accumulating repertoires of practices, they would continually modify them to suit the children’s needs. They were aware of the effects of words and would thus make their metacognitive and metalinguistic strategies available to the children. They believed in their students’ potential, had high expectations, and made sophisticated academic demands. The communication between the children’s families and them was reciprocal and dynamic. They also ensured that the routines, resources, physical facilities, and organisational practices were effective.

### Implications

The author identified that what was critical in helping the children who were experiencing the most challenge with school literacies was for the teachers to change their perceptions of children, families and literacies. She suggested that teachers be more engaged with both the children and their families by talking with and listening to them and their families, and by observing the children in different activity contexts.
