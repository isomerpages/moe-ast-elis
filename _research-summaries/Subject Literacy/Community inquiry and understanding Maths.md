### Background

Teachers on development programmes may not implement what they have learnt after returning to their own classrooms. This can be for many reasons. The development programme may not have altered their belief systems or the teachers may have subconsciously reinterpreted what was taught to fit in with what they have always done in the past.  
  
### Aims

The study looked at the effect on teachers and students when the development programme was followed up with further support through collaborative, school-based learning. A further aim was to develop the studentsâ€™ communication and participatory skills.  
  
### Sample

The report looks at two teachers and their maths classes in a small suburban primary school in New Zealand. The classes included Maori, Pasifika and other students who performed below the national average in maths. The teachers had already attended the Numeracy Development Project but had adapted what they had learnt to fit in with the methods they had always used.  
  
### Method

The professional development was carried out through whole-staff meetings and meetings of a teacher study group. The researcher involved was in the school two mornings a week working inside and outside the classes. The study group extensively used video recordings of lessons to discuss incidents and teacher actions. The researcher and teachers worked together to develop a Mathematics Communication and Participation Framework as a guide to how teachers and students should participate in communities of mathematical inquiry. Students were taught how to develop questioning and active listening skills and to build on what others said.  
  
### Findings

The effect sizes in terms of the growth in student mathematical skills after one year were large: d=2.39 and d=2.53 for the two classes. These represented four to five years of gains in usual classes. By the end of the study, the performance of each individual student was at least equal to the national average. The teachers learnt the importance of listening carefully to students and then adapting their teaching. Overall, teachers and students were more confident.  
  
### Implications

The study showed the importance of following up professional development courses with work in the schools. It also showed the benefits that could be gained by involving students and teachers in a learning community.
