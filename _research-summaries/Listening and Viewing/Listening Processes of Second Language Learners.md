### Background

The writer believes that there has been very little research describing the listening processes of second language learners.

### Aims

This study investigated the metacognitive awareness of 12-year-old students in listening comprehension. It examined (1) the factors that affect the students’ listening comprehension, (2) the strategies used, and (3) whether process-based discussions helped develop their awareness of the metacognitive processes involved in listening.

### Sample

Ten Primary 6 students from a Singapore primary school participated in the study. English was their second language while Mandarin was their first.

### Method

Data collection was carried out over eight sessions. The students listened to several English texts and answered questions on them. After that, they recorded their thoughts as they answered the questions in their notebooks (individual retrospection). After the report writing, they shared what they had written and the other students responded to them (group interviews).

### Findings

The findings showed that most of the factors that affected the students’ listening comprehension were related to the text, the task, and listener characteristics. The more frequently mentioned factors also came from these categories. Out of the 20 strategies reported by the students, ten were metacognitive strategies, nine were cognitive and one was socio-affective. Only one metacognitive strategy was ranked among the top four strategies used: Give full attention to listening text.

Comparing the first and the last sessions, the students gained a total of eight marks on average out of a total of 20 marks. All the students except one scored better or maintained their performance. The students who scored lower initially showed more dramatic improvements. This improvement was seen in the students’ scores in their school final examinations. The final short written report showed that the students were aware of the factors that could affect their listening comprehension skills as well as the strategies they had acquired. They were generally convinced that their listening abilities had improved.

### Implications

The author concluded that the students were capable of becoming metacognitively aware of factors and strategies involved in listening comprehension, a skill that could be further developed in class through process-based discussions.
