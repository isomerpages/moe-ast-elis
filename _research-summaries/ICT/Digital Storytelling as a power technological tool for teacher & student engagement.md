Robin, B. R. (2008). Digital storytelling: A powerful technology tool for the 21st century classroom. Theory into Practice, 47(3), 220-228.

### Background

The effective integration of technology into instruction is believed to improve teaching and learning. However, little attention has been given to a theoretical framework that can be used to enhance the use of technology in classroom learning.

### Aims

The article introduces a theoretical framework that can be used with digital storytelling (DST) to enhance the effectiveness of technology as a tool for student engagement in classrooms. It also reviews how the use of DST impacts student achievement.

### Sample

The paper is a theoretical article that presents the history of DST and how it is being integrated into classroom instruction.

### Method

The history of DST can be traced back to the movement initiated by the Centre for Digital Storytelling (CDS) where the seven elements of DST – point of view, posing a dramatic question, emotional content, the gift of one’s voice, the power of the soundtrack, economy, and pacing – were cited as useful reference points to begin working with digital stories.

The theoretical framework, known as technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPCK), emphasises the relationships between knowledge about content, pedagogy and technology. It forms the foundation of the integration of good teaching with technology and serves as a good pedagogical guide.

### Findings

The author found from the literature that the use of DST improved student comprehension. With the integration of DST, teachers could engage learners effectively not only in content discourse but also in discussions that made complex concepts more comprehensible. The greatest impact from using digital stories was found in the opportunities they provided for creating a strong foundation in five areas: (a) digital literacy – the ability to communicate across borders; (b) global literacy – the capacity to read, analyse, respond, and apply information from a global perspective; (c) technology literacy – the ability to use technology to enhance learning and performance; (d) visual literacy – the ability to comprehend, produce, and communicate through visual images; and (e) information literacy – the ability to find, assess, and combine information.

### Implications

Although DST can be used to engage and motivate learners, it is presently used in K-12 and higher education institutions with an emphasis on technical skills. The writer advocated more effort be put into understanding the subject content, the pedagogical skills and into how DST could address the needs of the learners.  He also emphasized the importance of embarking on research that made the link between greater student engagement and motivation and the effective use of technology.
