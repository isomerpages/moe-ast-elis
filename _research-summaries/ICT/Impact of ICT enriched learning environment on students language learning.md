### Background

The site of this research was the first primary school under the FutureSchools@Singapore programme. The school’score mission was to uncover innovative teaching approaches that leverage Information Communication Technology (ICT)to improve teaching and learning. A unique point about the school was that every student owned a personal notebook computer by the time they reached Primary 4.

### Aims

This study aimed to gain a deeper understanding of the possible impact and considerations for the learning of the English language in an ICT-enhanced learning environment.

### Sample

Participants of this study included the first 255 Primary 4 students on the programme as well as the five English teachers who had taught these students. All the teachers and students involved in the study had been in the school since its inception.

### Method

A case study approach was adopted. The following data were collected for analysis and triangulation – (1) teacher interviews; (2) survey on students’ frequency of use of ICT within the classroom; (3) students’ feedback; (4) students’ self-reported questionnaire survey on thinking skills; (5) students’ ICT skills test scores; (6) students’ English test scores, and (7) document review of scheme of work, lesson plans, and written reports.

### Findings

Findings revealed that students were highly motivated and engaged when ICT was used in the English lessons. Feedback gathered from teachers also indicated a high level of student engagement in ICT infused lessons. In addition, students’ English and ICT test scores were found to be significantly higher than those of their peers from a comparable school. 

Students were reportedly distracted by social networking and other online entertainment not related to their learning tasks. Technical glitches and hiccups (e.g., small computer screens, slow internet speeds)encountered during the lessons were also sources of frustration. In addition, students’ reflective thinking scores were not significantly influenced by the use of ICT.

### Implications

The authors stressed the importance of helping students be on task during ICT-based lessons by giving clear directions for the task. They also signalled the need for teachers to be more aware of the possible pitfalls of using technology (e.g., the playing of online games, the use of social networking sites during lessons) in the classroom, and to take into consideration the additional effort and skills needed for ICT integration when exploring a ‘future’ school approach.
