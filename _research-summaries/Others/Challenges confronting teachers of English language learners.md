Khong, T. D. H., & Saito, E. (2014). Challenges confronting teachers of English language learners. Educational Review, 66(2), 210-225. doi:10.1080/00131911.2013.769425

### Background

English Language Learners (ELLs) are an integral part of the US educational system. ELLs are defined as those who are from non-English speaking families and experience difficulties in understanding English. Given their great cultural and linguistic diversity, educating this population of students has posed a challenge for many US teachers. Although research has looked at various problems confronting ELL teachers, there are few studies that have systematically categorised the challenges encountered by these educators in their daily practices.

### Aims

This study investigated the challenges facing ELL teachers and the implications of these challenges.

### Method

The authors conducted 60 literature reviews relevant to the study and then coded each paper to identify the types of challenges detailed.

### Findings

The results showed that the teachers encountered many complex challenges which were categorised as social, institutional, and personal in nature. In terms of personal beliefs, the teachers had numerous misconceptions related to both the learning and teaching processes. Some misconceptions highlighted were:

1.  ELLs should be able to acquire English quickly;
2.  ELLs should avoid using their native language in order to acquire English;
3.  Exposure and interaction will result in English language learning; and
4.  All ELLs learn English in the same manner and at the same rate.

These misconceptions impeded the teachers’ ability to support ELLs effectively and could result in inaccurate evaluations regarding the language ability, intelligence, and motivation of ELLs, and negatively influence the teachers’ attitudes toward ELLs and the inclusion of English Language learning in content area teaching. The strong impact parental views had toward schooling and cultural capital added stress on the teachers. At the institutional level, it was reported that the teachers with the highest number of ELLs had received the least support from their schools.

### Implications

The authors highlighted that the challenges the teachers teaching ELLs faced had been discussed more in terms of institutional than social or personal matters, but it would be critical that these three factors were considered together, within a comprehensive framework, in order to alleviate the challenges English Language teachers faced. They suggested that not only was effort required on the part of teachers, schools, and teacher training institutions but social, economic, political, and educational policies also had to be improved at the national and state levels, and local communities needed to develop better understandings of ELLs and their families.
