Tan-Chia, L., Fang, Y., & Ang, P. C. (2013). Innovating the Singapore English Language curriculum through lesson study. International Journal for Lesson and Learning Studies, 2(3), 256-280. doi: 10.1108/IJLLS-03-2013-0017

### Background

The authors highlighted that literature on lesson studies has been dominated by mathematics and science cases and rarely any successful cases of lesson study involving English language have been reported to date.

### Aims

The authors implemented Project En-ELT (enhancing English language learning and teaching) to help teachers implement the English Language Syllabus 2010, and deepen teacher leadership in school-based curriculum planning, development and implementation through the use of lesson study. The teachers collaboratively engaged in instructional planning, enacted micro-teaching segments based on their lesson outline and the data collected from the observation notes recorded by the other teachers discussed at a colloquium.

### Sample

The participants included students of varying abilities in Grades 7 and 8, and fourteen teachers.

### Method

Data included workshop evaluation forms, school visit reports, lesson observations and Assessment for Learning (AfL) checklists, teacher discussion notes, teacher surveys and a descriptive vignette of each teacher’s participation in the project.

### Findings

The surveys demonstrated that the teachers had found the knowledge, perspectives and skills gained from the instructional planning (IP) cycles useful and applicable in their classrooms. IP had also fostered collaboration and improved teacher confidence when they co-designed their lessons. The teachers found that the opportunities to observe lessons live had enabled them to interpret the different uses of strategies in practice, and had highlighted potential pitfalls in teaching as well as best practices. They felt that the “critique” and lesson analysis during the colloquia fostered teamwork and enabled them to generalize principles for skilful teaching. They were able to identify and incorporate Assessment for Learning moments in their classroom practice as they progressed over the course of the three cycles. In terms of the impact on student learning, they claimed that the students had progressed in their use of English skills. The teaching strategies of retelling, reciprocal teaching and process writing, could be used not only to teach reading and writing but listening and speaking.

### Implications

The authors highlighted the issue of the sustainability of using the lesson study approach to mediate curriculum innovation. They suggested the exposure of teachers to the use of teaching strategies in all classes and appropriate lessons, the sharing of good practices beyond the year level and a sustained transfer of learning among teachers. To enhance the quality of classroom practice, there must be a continuous integration of strategy-rich lessons, deliberately and intentionally, in the school curriculum.
