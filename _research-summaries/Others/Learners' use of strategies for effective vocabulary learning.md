Moir, J., & Nation, I. S. (2002). Learners' use of strategies for effective vocabulary learning. Prospect, 17(1), 15-35.

### Background

There has been increasing interest in language learners and how they approach the task of learning. This learner-centred focus has significantly impacted classroom teaching and curriculum planning.

### Aims

The study explored the beliefs and strategies learners draw on to guide their vocabulary learning, the ways these beliefs and strategies are affected by the learners’ purposes in learning English and the learners’ previous experiences, and the effectiveness of these strategies.

### Sample

The participants were ten adult language learners in an intensive English as a second language course.

### Method

The data were gathered from semi-structured interviews, ‘think-aloud’ tasks, and a vocabulary test.

### Findings

The results indicated that the learners were using a limited set of vocabulary-learning strategies and had limited long-term retention of the meaning of words and a limited ability to use items learnt for the vocabulary component of the programme. Most learners were more concerned with meaning than the other critical aspects of word knowledge, such as collocations and other words in the same word family. Memorising was the most common consolidation strategy used although new vocabulary learning strategies had been taught. Many were unable to use the new words learnt communicatively or commit them to long-term memory due to the lack of revision and the fact that the selected vocabulary was of little relevance to them. Despite the dissatisfaction with the effects of their current learning behaviour, the learners were unwilling to adapt their learning or adopt strategies to suit their vocabulary learning needs. The vocabulary test results also demonstrated that they did not retain meanings or know how to use the items effectively. However, the interviews revealed that the ineffective vocabulary strategy use was not due to low motivation, but was attributable to the learners’ perceptions of teacher expectations, the pressure of the tests, and an insufficient awareness of their own word knowledge.

### Implications

The authors suggested that teachers spend more time with learners to help them decide the reasons for learning vocabulary and what they need to learn. Teachers should also work with individuals in consultations or small group discussions to help them determine their goals and vocabulary strategies to realize those goals. Learners need to constantly practise the strategies learnt and close monitoring of their development by teachers is essential. Learners also need to reflect on and question their own learning behaviour.
