Lim, C., Lee, C., Saito, E., & Syed Haron, S. (2011). Taking stock of Lesson Study as a platform for teacher development in Singapore. Asia-Pacific Journal of Teacher Education, 39(4), 353-365. doi: 10.1080/1359866X.2011.614683

### Background

The authors highlighted that the literature on Lesson Study (LS) focuses extensively on specific examples of LS cycles in improving classroom or school practices. Few studies have looked at changes at regional levels or trends in the implementation of LS.

### Aims

The authors sought to understand how LS protocols were modified to accommodate Singapore school contexts, the conditions that supported the implementation and sustainability of LS, and the kinds of challenges the schools experienced in the implementation process.

### Sample

The participants were selected from a database on attendance at workshops organised by the National Institute of Education. Out of 109 schools surveyed, 64 schools, consisting of 30 primary schools, 32 secondary schools, and two junior colleges, responded.

### Method

A survey method with mail-out questionnaires was selected as the most appropriate method to get a broad overview of the perceptions of school leaders and teachers about LS.

### Findings

The results indicated that of the 56 schools that had implemented LS, 28 were in their second year of implementation. Twenty-nine schools indicated that they would definitely continue implementing LS. In 22 schools, LS was initiated by the school leaders (SLs) and most felt that the LS had focussed on student learning and outcomes to a large extent. Many also indicated that involvement in LS had deepened teachers’ subject matter and pedagogical knowledge. Ensuring teachers’ time was protected for LS meetings and integrated into the timetable was perceived as the most important condition that supported the implementation of LS. Having a committed advocate among the teachers was also considered important. However, the teachers found it challenging to schedule in the research lesson and planning meetings as their lessons happened simultaneously. Other challenges included an initial apprehension among teachers and a lack of the know-how and time to implement LS. Most teachers were positive about LS and mentioned that the planning meetings provided platforms for them to generate, share and collaborate on lesson ideas.

### Implications

The authors highlighted that while teachers were generally convinced of the benefits of LS, they would require more support such as the provision of time and space for LS to develop in schools. They would also need help to access curriculum materials, teaching resource books, assessment exemplars, as well as resource persons who could support teacher deliberations during planning meetings and post-research lesson discussions.
