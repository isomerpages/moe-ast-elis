Lim, C., & Torr, J. (2007). Singaporean early childhood teachers' beliefs about literacy development in a multilingual context. Asia‐Pacific Journal of Teacher Education, 35(4), 409-434.

### Background

The preschool years are seen as having a significant impact on subsequent academic achievements. Having acknowledged the impact of teachers’ beliefs and knowledge on their own pedagogical practices, the author established the importance of understanding early childhood teachers’ beliefs about literacy development.

### Aims

This study sought to investigate Singaporean early childhood teachers’ beliefs about young children’s literacy development and pedagogy. The authors also hoped to uncover the key influences which have shaped the beliefs.

### Sample

79 Singaporean kindergarten teachers took part in this study.  Although the sample size was relatively small, it represented a good mix of teachers from diverse cultural and educational backgrounds and who varied in terms of professional qualifications, age, and years of teaching experience.

### Method

A survey method with a mailedquestionnaire was adopted for this study.  The teacher participants were asked to respond to 20 belief statements about literacy teaching and learning in early childhood classrooms and rank a list of factors that had influenced their beliefs about literacy development.

### Findings

Despite the diverse mix of participants, there was a strong consensus about several aspects of early literacy instruction and development. Almost all the participants viewed their primary goal of teaching literacy as fostering the children’s ability to communicate and express themselves freely. Many believed in using an eclectic approach rather than focusing on one or other ‘method’. In addition, more than half of the participants expressed uncertainty towards statements that resonate with a skills-based model (e.g., teacher directed teaching approaches, competence based assessment modes). However, almost 30% of the participants felt that children should be taught a set of prescribed rules rather than form their own rules concerning language.

Internal factors such as professional training and personal teaching experiences were reportedly most important in influencing the participants’ beliefs about literacy development and pedagogy. Contrary to the existing literature and the authors’ expectations, external factors such as pressure from parents and the school principal were less influential in shaping the participants’ beliefs. The majority of the participants felt that they were able to implement their beliefs about literacy development in their classroom practice.

### Implications

According to the authors, the findings of the reported study challenged many assumptions made about kindergarten teachers.  The authors urged early childhood professionals and teacher educators to pay more attention to the belief systems of kindergarten teachers.
