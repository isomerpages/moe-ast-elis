Lee, N. F. R. (2012). Writing as literacy development for low achievers: The case of a neighbourhood school in Singapore (Unpublished doctoral dissertation). University of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand.

### Background

This study was motivated by the desire to address Singapore’s stratified literacy instruction and the negative impact deficit pedagogical practices had on lower stream students.

### Aims

This study investigated (1) how different the writing culture between high- and low-achieving classes was, (2) how writing literacy in these classes was conceptualised, and (3) how effective a writing intervention based on sociocultural theory of writing would be in improving writing.

### Sample

One high-achieving and one low-achieving class (mean PSLE score: 204.2 and 169.9 respectively) of Secondary 3 students (n=79) from two secondary schools were chosen to participate in the study.

### Method

A questionnaire was used to find out how students were oriented towards school writing in terms of: (1) value and interest, (2) beliefs in own abilities, (3) affective feelings, (4) sustaining of motivation, and (5) regulation of cognitive and metacognitive strategies. Other data collected included transcripts from semi-structured interviews with focal students (n=8) and the English teachers (n=2), and classroom observations.

The writing intervention, which was implemented in the low-achieving class, used a reporting task to teach students to write in an expository style. Rhetorical features associated with the genre were explicitly taught. After the task, the students completed a questionnaire.

### Findings

The questionnaire showed that students in both classes shared similar orientations towards the five key motivational variables. The classroom observations showed little teaching of higher meta-cognitive skills or personal construction of voice and meaning in both classes. Differences in class disposition towards writing were observed. The high-achieving students were self-regulated, desired to succeed, and perceived the school and the teacher favourably, whereas the low-achieving students were disengaged, resisted writing, and perceived the teacher negatively. The writing intervention improved the low-achieving students’ writing performance. However, the students’ opinions of their own abilities remained the same as before.

### Implications

The author suggested that there was a need for curricular changes aimed at helping low achievers to enhance their experiences in doing writing at school, notably in teachers’ classroom practices.
