Bruning, R., & Horn, C. (2000). Developing motivation to write. Educational Psychologist, 35(1), 25-37.

### Background

Writing is a process that requires writers to constantly monitor their progress. However, this process is long and difficult and thus poses motivational challenges to writers. Many students feel anxious about writing. They dread and avoid it.

### Aims

The aim of the article was to examine the conditions that affect the development of the motivation to write.

### Sample

The sample included research articles addressing issues of development of writing motivation.

### Method

The authors analysed the nature of written discourse, linking motivational constructs and writing. They also analysed literature concerning motivation in general and writing teaching practices.

### Findings

The authors identified four clusters of factors in developing motivation to write: (a) nurturing students’ beliefs about the value of writing, (b) fostering student engagement through authentic writing tasks, (c) providing a supportive context for writing, and (d) creating a positive emotional environment.

### Implications

The authors recommended that to develop students’ motivation to write, teachers needed to get students to see the nature of writing and also its power as a communication tool. Having real objectives and audiences was also recommended as important motivational support. Third, students also needed to experience a positive writing environment. Some aspects of such an environment included breaking down a writing task into smaller chunks, setting small goals, receiving feedback on progress, and learning writing strategies. Lastly, students needed help to overcome their initial negative feelings about writing as well as their unproductive writing habits.
