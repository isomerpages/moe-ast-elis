Panadero, E., & Jonsson, A. (2013). The use of scoring rubrics for formative assessment purposes revisited: A review. Educational Research Review, 9, 129-144.

### Background

Recent years have seen an increased interest in the use of scoring rubrics with students for formative purposes. Research findings, however, have been found to be inconclusive. It is not known how rubrics may facilitate in improving student performance or which factors are important in changing the potential effect.

### Aims

The aim of this review was to examine whether and how the formative use of rubrics have an effect on student learning.

### Sample

The sample comprised 21 studies that investigated the formative use of rubrics.

### Method

The authors used content analysis to compare the samples, subject/tasks, procedures, designs, and results among the studies in relation to whether these had an effect on how students performed and regulated themselves in the learning process.

### Findings

The results of the analysis suggest that the formative use of rubrics can have a positive impact on student learning and that their use mediates improved student performance through the following factors:

Increased transparency (Students knew what was expected of them.);

Reduced anxiety (Students who were provided with rubrics reported less anxiety regarding the assignment because rubrics clarify expectations.);

Enhanced feedback process (Students and teachers found that rubrics helped in the feedback process.);

Improved self-efficacy (Students who were provided with rubrics and supported by mastery feedback were more confident of completing the task well.); and

Enhanced student self-regulation (Having rubrics helped students plan their assignments and assess themselves.).

Factors that moderate the effects of the formative use of rubrics include the combinations of rubrics and meta-cognitive activities such as self- and peer assessment, the students’ educational level, and the length of intervention.

### Implications

Future studies need to use an experimental or quasi-experimental research design rather than a descriptive design.  They need to examine the effects of using different rubric designs (holistic vs. analytical; varied by the number of levels; task specific vs. generic) on student learning. They also need to examine whether personal differences in the use of rubrics such as prior academic performance, self-regulation strategies and goal orientation have an effect on student learning.  They can compare how the use of rubrics with different activities (feedback, self- and peer assessment) affects student learning, and whether there is a relationship between gender and the use of rubrics.
