Pajares, F. (2003). Self-efficacy beliefs, motivation, and achievement in writing: A review of the literature. Reading & Writing Quarterly, 19(2), 139-158.

### Background

Some researchers believed that the way people learned could be explained without considering their internal mental states and that their behaviour could be explained by external forces. However, Bandura (1986) proposed that individuals possessed self-beliefs that allowed them to control their thoughts, feelings, and actions.

### Aims

The purpose of this article was to examine how the self-efficacy component of Bandura’s (1986) social cognitive theory contributed to the investigation of writing in schools and universities.

### Sample

This article examined what was written about self-efficacy, motivation and achievement in writing before 2003. Writing self-efficacy is how students perceive their own writing competence.

### Method

The author described how writing self-beliefs were operationalized and measured in research on writing. He then synthesized research findings, addressing how writing self-efficacy, other motivation constructs related to writing, and writing outcomes were associated with one another.

### Findings

In terms of psychometrics, a writing self-efficacy scale of 0-100 response format has been found to be stronger than scales using a Likert format and has better predictive ability of students’ writing grades and teacher ratings of their students’ writing competence. When the self-efficacy items correspond more closely to the writing outcomes that are to be measured, the writing self-efficacy scale has better predictive ability. The findings of the review suggest that writing self-efficacy beliefs are consistently associated with writing achievement. Confidence in self-regulatory learning strategies has also been associated with higher intrinsic motivation and academic achievement. When students are taught self-regulatory strategies for writing, writing self-efficacy and performance increase.

### Implications

The author recommended that teachers should focus on both students’ perceptions of their competence as well as their actual competence because students’ perceptions may predict more accurately their motivation and future academic choices. Inaccurate self-beliefs rather than low competence may lead students to avoid courses and particular careers as well as lead to lower school interest and achievement. Teachers and schools should help students develop a sense of confidence and competence by giving them meaningful and challenging tasks and by supporting and encouraging them.
