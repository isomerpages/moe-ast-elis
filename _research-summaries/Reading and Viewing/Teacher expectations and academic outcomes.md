Rubie‐Davies, C., Hattie, J., & Hamilton, R. (2006). Expecting the best for students: Teacher expectations and academic outcomes. British Journal of Educational Psychology, 76(3), 429-444.  
  
### Background

Prior research has shown that teacher expectations have an effect on student achievement. It has also been suggested that various student characteristics shape teacher expectations for student achievement.  
  
### Aims

The study examined the impact of students’ ethnicity on teachers’ expectations and their judgments of the students’ reading performance.   
  
### Sample
Involved in the study were 540 Maori, Asian, Pacific Island, and New Zealand European primary students of 21 teachers from 12 Auckland schools. Ten teachers taught at the junior level (Year 1 and/or 2) and 11 taught at the senior level (Year 5 and/or 6).  
  
### Method

An initial expectation survey was conducted one month into the academic year to allow time for teachers to form academic expectations of their students, Teachers were asked to indicate what levels they expected their students to achieve in reading by the end of the year. At the end of the year, they judged the reading levels their students had actually achieved. A 7-point Likert scale was used at both time periods. At regular intervals, teachers conducted running records on their students’ oral reading behaviours using a set of procedures and conventions. The survey data were compared with the running record data at the end of the year.  
  
### Findings

Teacher expectations were significantly higher than the actual reading achievement for all ethnic groups other than for Maori students. The initial reading achievement of Maori students was similar to that of the other groups but teachers rated them lower. Pacific Island children’s performance was weaker but teachers rated them higher. By the end of the year, Maori students made the least gains. Anecdotal evidence suggested that teachers thought that Asian students were industrious, Pacific Island students had strict upbringing, and Maori students came from less supportive home backgrounds as compared to the other ethnic groups.  
  
### Implications

Differing expectations could result from the stereotyping of students. The theorising of a sustaining expectation effect explained the limited progress of Maori students. For Pacific Island, Asian and New Zealand European students, positive self-fulfilling prophecies may be operating. The study called for teachers to examine their beliefs and consequent expectations to see if these could be variables that significantly influence students’ opportunity to learn.
