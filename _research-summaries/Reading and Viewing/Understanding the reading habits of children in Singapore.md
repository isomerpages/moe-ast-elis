### Background

Although research has documented substantial improvement in the language competencies of children engaging in leisure reading, studies have also shown a significant decrease in book reading with increasing age. Literature suggests numerous factors, especially technological advancements, are likely to impact reading habits of children.

### Aims

This study examined the reading habits and preferences of children, their motivations behind reading and their attitudes towards leisure reading.

### Sample

Four hundred and forty pupils, ages ranging from 9 to 12 years, from 12 classes in three primary schools, participated in this study.

### Method

A questionnaire comprising three parts was administered. The first section covered pupils’ demographics. The second section collected responses on their reading habits and attitudes towards leisure reading. For the third segment, pupils were asked to indicate their preferences for reading materials, subject interests and motivations for leisure reading.

### Findings

Sixty-two percent of the pupils indicated that they read to achieve better results in tests and examinations. The authors attributed this to the strong emphasis on academic performance in Singapore. Another dominant motivation for reading leisure books was to improve language skills. The other commonly mentioned motivations for leisure reading were to gain more knowledge, to relax and to cultivate reading as a hobby.

Eighty percent of the pupils reported reading for leisure at least once a week and 47.3 percent almost daily, while 13.9 percent were doing so every other day. Girls appeared to be the more avid readers.   
The main reading material sources came from public libraries (34%), bookstores (32%) and school libraries (25%). The majority preferred to read leisurely at home (64%). Storybooks were the most favoured type of reading materials, followed by comics, magazines, the Internet, non-fiction books and newspapers. The two most preferred fictional subjects were mysteries and adventure books, while non-fiction books on hobbies, animals and plants were also popular among children.

### Implications

The authors suggested the establishment of leisure reading at an early age to cultivate the love for reading and thereby improve children’s reading. They posited the need for more time for fun reading in schools. They also underlined the important role of teachers and parents in educating children to maintain a balance in leisure activities as 44.1 per cent indicated reading as their favourite leisure activity as opposed to 57.6 percent who preferred the computer. The public and school libraries could also provide children with the genres of books that they had indicated their preference for so that the motivation for leisure reading could be developed and sustained.
