Lesaux, N. K. (2012). Reading and reading instruction for children from low-income and non-English-speaking households. The Future of Children, 22(2), 73-88.

### Background

Young American children appeared to be able to read well in lower primary levels but many had problems reading in upper primary and at secondary levels.

### Aims

The aim of the paper was to use research conducted with children from low-income and non-English-speaking homes to explain why many American middle school and high school students struggled with texts.

### Sample

The author selected research on reading development and instruction with an emphasis on such research conducted with children from low-income and non-English-speaking homes.

### Findings

The author distinguished between two types of reading competencies: skills-based and knowledge-based. Skills-based reading competencies require readers to sound out and recognize words while knowledge-based reading competencies involve having conceptual and vocabulary knowledge to understand the meaning of a text. Students need to have relevant prior knowledge about the text’s topic, vocabulary, and structure for reading comprehension. Elementary schools were found to have made progress in the teaching of skills-based reading competencies. However, middle and high schools had not made as much progress in teaching knowledge-based reading competencies for understanding texts. Children from low-income and non-English-speaking homes were able to master relatively quickly skills-based reading competencies taught in elementary schools. By contrast, struggling readers from both non-English-speaking and monolingual English-speaking homes had problems with vocabulary knowledge at middle and high school. Even though their growth in skills-based reading was faster, it was not fast enough to overcome the large gap they began school with, so children from non-English-speaking homes who had lower scores in English proficiency than their monolingual peers in kindergarten performed significantly worse than their peers in fifth grade.

### Implications

The author recommended that schools conduct comprehensive reading assessments that allow teachers to understand students’ sources of reading difficulties. These assessments should include both skills-based and knowledge-based reading competencies in the early to later grades so that teachers can design systematic reading instruction for young and older readers who need support in developing knowledge-based reading competencies that are important for academic success. The author recommended that future instruction should include deep language- and content-based instruction with an emphasis on the teaching of specialized vocabulary and language structures in spoken and written academic language.
