### Background

In this paper, the author calls for greater emphasis on model reading by teachers. He argues that reading is an important determinant of a student’s growth in language skills and ability and that teachers play an instrumental role in modelling this practice.  
  
### Aims

This study examined teachers’ beliefs in the importance of reading and modelling reading. It investigated how well teachers actually modelled reading during Uninterrupted Sustained Silent Reading (USSR), to what extent students noticed whether their teachers were reading, and whether they were affected by their observations.  
  
### Sample

Fifty teachers from one Singapore primary school participated in the study.  
  
### Method

The teachers were observed during daily USSR sessions. All fifty teachers completed a questionnaire and 10 teachers participated in semi-structured interviews. Six lower-ability classes from Primary 2, 4, and 6 completed the questionnaire and 10 students participated in semi-structured interviews.  
  
### Findings

The questionnaire showed that many of the teachers believed in the importance of reading and a substantial number (54%) thought that they modelled reading. The interviews revealed that all the teachers felt that reading was important and that teachers should model reading.  
  
The gap between belief and practice was confirmed by observations which showed that teachers modelled reading to a very small extent. The number of teachers who modelled reading during USSR never exceeded three at any one time. Non-USSR activities, such as remediation programmes, were run simultaneously with USSR, which meant that between eight and 35 teachers could be absent from USSR on any one day.  
  
The student questionnaire revealed that the students noticed if their teachers were not reading. The majority of students wanted their form teachers to read with them, and they did not want their teachers to engage in activities other than reading during USSR. In the interview, only two students stated that their teacher had explained the purpose of USSR.  
  
### Implications

The author recommends that schools re-examine their reading programmes to determine if they are beneficial for students and whether teachers are modelling reading effectively.
