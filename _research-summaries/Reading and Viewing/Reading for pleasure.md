Harrison, B. (2012). Reading for pleasure among Year 13 boys: What are the possibilities and problems? Kairaranga,13(2), 41-48.

### Background

Boys underperform in areas of reading and literacy compared to girls and they become less engaged with literacy and reading as they grow older.

### Aims

This study examined how Year 13 boys could be encouraged to read for pleasure on a regular basis. Specifically, it investigated the ways in which speed-booking encouraged these boys to read for pleasure and how book buying and the creation of a reading community encouraged reading among them.

### Sample

Two English classes of Year 13 boys in one secondary school formed the intervention group while one statistics class of Year 13 boys formed the comparison group.

### Method

All participants completed a survey on the time they spent reading and their reading preferences. The boys in the intervention group took part in a speed-booking activity where each group of four boys was given a time limit to peruse books on a table and each boy could choose one book. In the next round, the boys could either keep the book that they had selected or exchange it. At the end of this activity, the boys could borrow more books. Two boys from each class were also asked to choose which books to buy along with a librarian and to explain their choices to their classmates. Four boys were interviewed about their reading habits. The number of books borrowed during the intervention period was also noted. The survey and interview data were analysed using content analysis to identify common themes.

### Findings

The borrowing statistics showed that after the speed-booking intervention, more books were borrowed by the boys in the intervention group than those in the comparison group. After the book-buying and discussion exercise, the boys from the intervention group borrowed more books than the comparison group and reserved new books. Analyses revealed that the boys read widely and could usually find their preferred reading material in the library. The boys preferred to read newspapers and magazines and read online material regularly. They frequented current affairs and social news Internet sites. The boys commented that they lacked time for reading because of academic work and sporting commitments.

### Implications

The author recommended that boys should be encouraged to read for pleasure by creating a more student-centred environment where they would feel more involved and connected and by catering to their reading interests.
