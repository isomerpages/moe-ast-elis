### Background

Parental involvement in their teenagers’ education, including their literacy development, has been marginal in Singapore.

### Aims

This study focused on parental involvement in the development of goals for students' literacy development.

### Sample

The author and her team member worked with Secondary 1 teachers, students, and parents, and the school leaders.

### Method

In 2005, the researchers and participants of this study discussed issues concerning adolescent literacy and school-home relationships. A total of 180 parents responded to surveys on possible workshop topics and parents' perceptions of current school-home relationships. Eight students participated in a focus group discussion about learning and parental involvement, and fifteen students on adolescent literacy practices, and parental and school involvement in such practices. Fourteen teachers responded on issues that they felt were important. The research team interviewed four teachers and teacher-librarians, three school leaders, two parents, and two students, about school-home partnerships in the school, and about the meanings of reading and literacy, and of learning.

### Findings

The results of the parent survey indicated that most parents had positive views on current school-home relationships. Parents' preferences concerning workshop topics showed more concern about home-based parental involvement, their relationship with their adolescent, followed by a strong interest in learning about ways to be involved in their teenager's learning and literacy practices at home. However, parents felt that there was greater support for parents helping at school rather than at home.

Students in the focus groups engaged in a broad range of literacy practices. They desired improved relationships and communication with their parents, and would like teachers to have a better understanding of their out-of-school lives. The teachers surveyed preferred the workshop topic to be improved school-home relationships. However, one teacher expressed doubt that parents could help their adolescents become better readers. Teachers, school leaders, and parents had strong biases against digital reading.

### Implications

The author suggested that changing the belief system of stakeholders was the key for sustained change in schools. She recommended that stakeholders needed to have shared understandings concerning adolescent literacy and that there was the need for parental involvement and school-home partnerships.
