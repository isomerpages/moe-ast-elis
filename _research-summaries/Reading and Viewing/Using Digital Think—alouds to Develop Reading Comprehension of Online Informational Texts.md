White, A. (2016). Using Digital Think-Alouds to Build Comprehension of Online Informational Texts. The Reading Teacher, 69(4), 421- 425.

### Background

Online reading involves processes and operations which can be more challenging than reading print texts. Quite often young learners have limited exposure to informational texts as compared to literary texts in school. How much instruction do teachers provide in navigating informational texts, especially in digital text formats? Students need explicit instruction on how to read both digital and print informational texts effectively.

### Aims

This study examines how the use of metacognitive processes, screencasting and Internet Reciprocal Teaching (IRT) can facilitate the deconstruction of online reading processes. It identifies the component skills of online informational reading that can develop students’ proficiency in online reading comprehension.

### Sample

The study involved a group of upper elementary and middle school students.

### Method

The initial stage of the research began with students using screencasting tools to capture their think-alouds as they read digital informational texts. The purpose was to make thinking visible and raise awareness of the reading processes involved in an online environment. The next stage incorporated the use of the IRT strategy for reading digital texts involving four strategies, namely predicting, clarifying, questioning and summarising. Using the Gradual Release of Responsibility approach, students progressed from teacher-led IRT instruction including modelling, to collaborative work between students and teachers and finally to small group independent work with students negotiating the meaning of online informational texts read. The final stage focused on combining screencasting and IRT where students engaged in peer teaching. They produced tutorial clips using their chosen screencasting tool and annotated digitally their screencast to explain key strategies that assisted them in reading online informational texts.

### Findings

Through combining screencasting and IRT, the students could record their thinking processes and strategies used in meaning construction. In order to produce the tutorial clips, students had to clearly articulate their cognitive processes by noticing and naming them for themselves and also other students for whom these clips served as learning resources. With repeated recordings of thought processes, students progressed from conscious use of reading strategies to achieving automaticity of skills.

### Implications

With the emergence of new Web technologies, students need to learn to manoeuvre through different types of informational texts. The use of screencasting and IRT during reading practices can enhance students’ metacognitive skills and reading comprehension of such texts.
