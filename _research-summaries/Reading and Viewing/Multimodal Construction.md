Tang, K.-S., Tan, S. C., & Yeo, J. (2011). Students’ multimodal construction of the work-energy concept.International Journal of Science Education, 33(13), 1775-1804. doi: 10.1080/09500693.2010.508899

### Background

Language has been defined as all modes of representation – verbal, visual, mathematical and gestural. These modes can be used to present scientific concepts through alternative representations of the same concept or as a single multimodal representation. Some concepts can only be explained through multimodal representation and these can cause difficulties if not presented carefully.

### Aims

The writers examine students’ learning of a concept through multimodal integration, i.e. the use of a number of modes together. They are interested in the idea that some scientific concepts can only be represented through a particular constellation of modes and in investigating the difficulties students may face integrating these modes.

### Sample

The research was done with a ninth grade class from the Integrated Programme designed for the top 10% of students in Singapore. The class worked in groups of four to five. Each student had an Internet-connected personal notebook. The lesson unit involved three two-hour lessons with students working together to gain an understanding of the work-energy concept.

### Method

The researchers chose one group to observe because the members talked and worked well together thus providing sufficient data. They recorded the conversation, the symbols and graphics used and the students’ use of gesture. They only assisted the group when they ran into difficulties.

### Findings

The students’ difficulties with the concept of work-energy included its abstract language that turned an activity (a verb, e.g. an object doing work) into a nominalization (a noun, e.g. work done) and then into symbolised entities (e.g., Wexternal) and the different forms of representation necessary to fully explain the concept. The researchers showed how the students in the observed group used various mixes of verbal, mathematical, visual and gestural language over the three lessons to work towards an understanding of the target concept.

### Implications

Course writers and teachers need to unpack the different subtle meanings that arise from the use of each representation, including language, diagrams, equations and graphs, examining how each representation is interconnected to one another for every concept stated in the syllabus. They must then make explicit the connections among the different representations and help students integrate them seamlessly.
