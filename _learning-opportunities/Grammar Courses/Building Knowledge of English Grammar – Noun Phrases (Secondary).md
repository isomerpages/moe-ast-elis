<em>What are noun phrases made up of? How long should a noun phrase be? How can I explain when a noun phrase has been correctly or incorrectly constructed? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview
In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of noun phrases, including the head noun and pre- and post-modification, in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach noun phrases accurately and effectively. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable your students to use their understanding of noun phrases to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent appropriately and more effectively. To make your learning meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate understanding of noun phrases in the English Language Syllabus 2020;
*   apply your understanding to interpret your students’ questions and answers on noun phrases, teach noun phrases to your students, and explore the use of a variety of grammar references; and
*   explain how you will know when your students have constructed noun phrases appropriately and effectively.
