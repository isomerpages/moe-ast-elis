<em>What are time, tense and aspect in the English language? How can I explain when to use the present tense and when to use the present perfect? How do I know if one is more appropriate than the other, and how do I explain exceptions to the rule? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of the concepts of time, tense and aspect in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and enable your students to use their understanding of time, tense and aspect to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. You will also consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. For your learning to be meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals


By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* demonstrate understanding of time, tense and aspect in the EL Syllabus 2020;
* apply your understanding to interpret your students’ questions and answers on these concepts, teach time, tense and aspect to your students, and explore the use of a variety of grammar references; and
* explain how you will know when your students have used tense and aspect accurately and effectively.
