<em>What are time, tense and aspect in the English language? How can I explain when to use the present tense and when to use the present perfect? How do I explain exceptions to the rule? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of the concepts of time, tense and aspect in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively.
