<em>What are word classes in the English language? How do I know if a word is a verb, a noun, an adjective, an adverb, or something else? How can I explain why a word is sometimes a verb and sometimes an adjective? Why should I know about the form, function and meaning of words? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview
In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of word classes in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach word classes accurately and effectively. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable your students to use their understanding of word classes to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. To make your learning meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals&nbsp;
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate understanding of word classes in the English Language Syllabus 2020;
*   apply your understanding to interpret your students’ questions and answers on word classes, teach word classes to your students, and explore the use of a variety of grammar references; and
*   explain how you will know when your students have understood word classes in the English language.
