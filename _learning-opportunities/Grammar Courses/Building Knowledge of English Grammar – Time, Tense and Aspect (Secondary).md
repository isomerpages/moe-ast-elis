<em>What are time, tense and aspect in the English language? How can I explain when to use the past tense and when to use the past perfect? How do I know when one is more appropriate than the other? How can I explain exceptions to the rule? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of the concepts of time, tense and aspect in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively.
