<p><em>What are time, tense and aspect in the English language? How can I explain when to use the present tense and when to use the present perfect? How do I know if one is more appropriate than the other, and how do I explain exceptions to the rule? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of the concepts
of time, tense and aspect in the English language. You will be able to
apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and enable
your students to use their understanding of time, tense and aspect to listen,
read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. You will also
consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts
to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.
For your learning to be meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity
