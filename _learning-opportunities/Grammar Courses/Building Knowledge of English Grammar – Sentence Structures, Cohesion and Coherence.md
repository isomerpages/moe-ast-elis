<p><em>What are sentences made up of? How can I explain to my students when a sentence has been correctly or incorrectly constructed? Why is it that my students can use a variety of sentence structures but the meaning is still unclear? What is the relationship between sentence structure, cohesion and coherence? How can I explain this relationship to my students?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of syntax, grammatical
functions, cohesion, coherence, and their relationship to one another.
You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately
and enable your students to use their understanding of these concepts to
listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. You will
also consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts
to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.
For your learning to be meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity
to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’
work.</p>
