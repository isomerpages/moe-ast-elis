*What are sentences made up of? How can I explain to my students when a sentence has been correctly or incorrectly constructed? Why is it that my students can use a variety of sentence structures but the meaning is still unclear? What is the relationship between sentence structure, cohesion and coherence? How can I explain this relationship to my students?*

### Overview
In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of syntax, grammatical functions, cohesion, coherence, and their relationship to one another. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and enable your students to use their understanding of these concepts to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. You will also consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. For your learning to be meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.
### Learning Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* demonstrate understanding of sentence structures, the grammatical functions of the parts of a sentence, and how they relate to cohesion and coherence in the EL Syllabus 2020;
* apply your understanding to interpret your students’ writing, in particular their use of various sentence structures to achieve cohesion and coherence; and
* explain these concepts to your students accurately and effectively.
