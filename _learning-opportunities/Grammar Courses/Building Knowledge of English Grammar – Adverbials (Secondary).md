<em>What are adverbials? Why do students need to know how to use them? How are adverbials connected with cohesion and coherence in the English language? How can I explain this relationship accurately to my students? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of adverbials and their connection with cohesion and coherence in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively.
