<em>What is subject-verb agreement in the English language? Why do some verbs in a sentence need to agree with their subjects while others do not? How do I explain exceptions to the rule? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of the concepts of subject-verb agreement and the finiteness of verbs in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how you can enable your students to use their understanding of subjectverb agreement and the finiteness of verbs to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. To make your learning meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate understanding of subject-verb agreement and the finiteness of verbs in the English Language Syllabus 2020;
*   apply your understanding to interpret your students’ questions and answers on these concepts, teach subject-verb agreement and the finiteness of verbs to your students, and explore the use of a variety of grammar references; and
*   explain how you will know when your students have applied subjectverb agreement accurately.
