<p><em>What are word classes in the English language? How do I know if a word is a verb, a noun, an adjective, an adverb, or something else? How can I explain why a word is sometimes a verb and sometimes an adjective? Why should I know about the form, function and meaning of words? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of word classes
in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to
teach word classes accurately and enable your students to use their understanding
of word classes to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more
effectively. You will also consider ways to use educational technology
in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory,
connected and reflective classrooms. For your learning to be meaningful
and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding
through analysing and responding to your students’ work.</p>
