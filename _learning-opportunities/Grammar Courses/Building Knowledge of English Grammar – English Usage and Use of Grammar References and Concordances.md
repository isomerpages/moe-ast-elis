*Should it be ‘the committee has met’ or ‘the committee have met’? Do we ‘decide something’ or ‘decide on something’? When do we use ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘in’ with reference to a place? Can the past tense be used for something taking place in the present? How can I explain to my students when grammatical rules do not seem to apply? What can I do to make sense of the grammar of English?*

### Overview
In this course, you will attain clearer understanding about the grammar of English beyond a common conception of it as a set of grammatical rules with many exceptions. You will apply your understanding of how and why to use particular grammatical structures to enable your students to use them accurately, appropriately and effectively. You will learn to use grammar references and concordances to support your own and your students’ learning about English usage. You will also consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. For your learning to be meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

* demonstrate understanding of the grammar of English as more than just a set of grammatical rules, items and structures;
* apply your understanding to interpret and guide your students’ learning and use of English, especially when grammatical rules do not seem to apply; and
* use grammar references and concordances to support your own and your students’ learning about English usage.
