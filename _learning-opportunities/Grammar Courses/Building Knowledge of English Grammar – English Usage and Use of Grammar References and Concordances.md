<p><em>Should it be ‘the committee has met’ or ‘the committee have met’? Do we ‘decide something’ or ‘decide on something’? When do we use ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘in’ with reference to a place? Can the past tense be used for something taking place in the present? How can I explain to my students when grammatical rules do not seem to apply? What can I do to make sense of the grammar of English?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this course, you will attain clearer understanding about the grammar
of English beyond a common conception of it as a set of grammatical rules
with many exceptions. You will apply your understanding of how and why
to use particular grammatical structures to enable your students to use
them accurately, appropriately and effectively. You will learn to use grammar
references and concordances to support your own and your students’ learning
about English usage. You will also consider ways to use educational technology
in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory,
connected and reflective classrooms. For your learning to be meaningful
and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding
through analysing and responding to your students’ work.</p>
