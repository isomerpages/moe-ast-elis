<em>What is a productive academic discussion? How can I carry out a productive academic discussion in my classroom?</em>

### Overview

Productive academic discussions provide students with opportunities to clarify their thinking, deepen their reasoning, listen to and engage with one another’s reasoning, and consolidate their conceptual understanding of subject content. This course explores how teachers can facilitate such discussions in their classroom and overcome common challenges.

*   understand how a productive academic discussion can support your students’ learning;
