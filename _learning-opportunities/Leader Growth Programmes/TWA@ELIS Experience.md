TWA@ELIS provides EL Teacher Leader participants with opportunities to observe PMTTs and MTTs facilitate teacher learning and to have professional conversations with them. Participants will also have opportunities to speak with the SSs about the nature and study of the English Language. 

EL Teacher Leader participants can look forward to strengthening their knowledge bases in subject content and pedagogy including assessment, and critically inquiring into the use of technology for active learning in participatory, connected and reflective EL classrooms.

Participants will inquire into and apply andragogical principles to design, review and facilitate EL teacher learning experiences.  They will be guided to review and refine the professional learning plan for teachers in their EL department/cluster/zone. 

Participants can also look forward to time and space for consolidating their knowledge and reflecting critically on their practice as EL teachers and Teacher Leaders.
