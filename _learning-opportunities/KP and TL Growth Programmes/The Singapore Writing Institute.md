<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>ELIS is an Associated International Site of the National Writing Project
(NWP), a well-established professional learning experience for teachers
in the USA. We are certified to facilitate the Singapore Writing Institute
(SWI),&nbsp; which is modelled on the Invitational Summer Writing Institute
of the NWP. SWI is a ten-day professional learning opportunity for you
to experience yourself as a writer, in order to become a better teacher
of writing and representing. With the support of the Singapore Writing
Project team, you will undertake an inquiry that spans one and a half years.</p>
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
<p>By the end of SWI, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>demonstrate awareness of</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>the purposes for writing and representing, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the processes of writing and representing;</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>develop an understanding of current research and theoretical perspectives
regarding writing and representing, and how such an understanding can inform
your teaching of writing and representing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make informed decisions about your choice of teaching and learner strategies
to support learners with diverse needs as they learn to write and represent;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>consider the use of appropriate formative assessment tools to assess your
students’ development in writing and representing;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>design and undertake an inquiry, and</p>

<p>lead others in learning about writing and representing.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Programme Structure</h3>
