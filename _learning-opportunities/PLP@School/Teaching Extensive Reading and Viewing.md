### Getting Students Hooked on Books

Why do my students not improve in their reading comprehension and vocabulary despite the many reading lessons in class? How would a habit of wide and extensive reading and viewing address this problem? What can my school and I put in place to support students to develop and reap the benefits of a reading habit, including in blended learning contexts?

### Overview

This learning programme aims to enable you to plan, enact and review a programme for extensive reading and viewing. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will learn how to motivate your students to read and view independently and with others for enjoyment.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this learning programme , you will be able to:

*   demonstrate and apply knowledge of the principles and practice of teaching extensive reading and viewing;
*   guide students to set and regulate personal reading goals to independently read and view, extensively and with enjoyment, materials that will raise their level of understanding and knowledge for self-efficacy and for learning; and
*   plan, enact and review an extensive reading and viewing programme for a target group of students.
