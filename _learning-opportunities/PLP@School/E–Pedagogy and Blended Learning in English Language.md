### Enabling Participatory, Connected and Reflective English Language Learning

How can I harness technology effectively to foster active learning in a blend of in-person and online learning contexts in my English Language (EL) classroom? What will I use to guide the design of my lessons, and selection and use of information and communication technology tools in these contexts? How will I know if I have applied e-pedagogy and blended learning effectively in the teaching of EL?
