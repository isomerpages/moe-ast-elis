<h3><strong>Building Knowledge of English Grammar – English Usage and Use of Grammar References and Concordances (Primary and Secondary)</strong></h3>
<p><em>Should it be ‘the committee has met’ or ‘the committee have met’? Do we ‘decide something’ or ‘decide on something’? When do we use ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘in’ with reference to a place? Can the past tense be used for something taking place in the present? How can I explain to my students when grammatical rules do not seem to apply? What can I do to make sense of the grammar of English?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In this course, you will attain clearer understanding about the grammar
of English beyond a common conception of it as a set of grammatical rules
with many exceptions. You will apply your understanding of how and why
to use particular grammatical structures to enable your students to use
them accurately, appropriately and effectively. You will learn to use grammar
references and concordances to support your own and your students’ learning
about English usage. You will also consider ways to use EdTech, including
AI,&nbsp;to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective
classrooms. For your learning to be meaningful and relevant, you will have
the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding
to your students’ work.</p>
