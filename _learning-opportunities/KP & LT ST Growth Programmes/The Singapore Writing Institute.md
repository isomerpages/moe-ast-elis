### Overview
ELIS is an Associated International Site of the National Writing Project (NWP), a well-established professional learning experience for teachers in the USA. We are certified to facilitate the Singapore Writing Institute (SWI),&nbsp; which is modelled on the Invitational Summer Writing Institute of the NWP. SWI is a ten-day professional learning opportunity for you to experience yourself as a writer, in order to become a more effective teacher of writing and representing. With the support of the Singapore Writing Project team, you will undertake an inquiry that spans one and a half years.

### Learning Goals

By the end of SWI, you will:

*   demonstrate awareness of

*   the purposes for writing and representing, and
*   the processes of writing and representing;

*   develop an understanding of current research and theoretical perspectives regarding writing and representing, and how such an understanding can inform the teaching of writing and representing;

*   make informed decisions about your choice of teaching and learner strategies to support learners with diverse needs as they learn to write and represent;

*   consider the use of appropriate formative assessment tools to assess your studentsâ€™ development in writing and representing;

*   design and undertake an inquiry, and;

*   lead others in learning about writing and representing.

### Programme Structure

You can look forward to:

*   a half-day orientation session to prepare you for SWI;
*   a ten-day programme with a blend of in-person and online synchronous and asynchronous learning sessions; and	 
*   four post-SWI sessions to support your application of learning.

### Who may Apply
EL KP, TLs and potential KP/TLs in primary and secondary schools are invited to apply. Applicants should be in a position to influence the teaching and learning in their schools.

Those who participate will:

*   commit to deepening their understanding of writing and representing processes and be willing to explore their pedagogical practices;
*   be willing to write and talk about their practices of writing and representing;
*   be reflective, enthusiastic and open to receiving feedback on their writing and representing as well as to giving feedback to others;
*   commit to applying what they have learnt in their classrooms;
*   demonstrate teacher leadership by influencing their peers as well as their students to write and represent more effectively; and
*   contribute to the learning of the SWI alumni by presenting the learning from their inquiry into the teaching of writing and representing.
