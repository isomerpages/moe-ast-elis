### Overview

ELIS is an Associated International Site of the National Writing Project (NWP), a well-established professional learning experience for teachers in the USA. We are certified to facilitate the Singapore Writing Institute (SWI), which is modelled on the Invitational Summer Writing Institute of the NWP. SWI is a ten-day professional learning opportunity for you to experience yourself as a writer, in order to become a better teacher of writing and representing. With the support of the Singapore Writing Project Team, you will undertake an inquiry that spans one and a half years.

### Learning Goals

By the end of SWI, you will:

*   demonstrate awareness of

*   the purposes for writing and representing, and
*   the processes of writing and representing;

*   develop an understanding of current research and theoretical perspectives regarding writing and representing, and how such an understanding can inform the teaching of writing and representing;
*   make informed decisions about your choice of teaching and learner strategies to support learners with diverse needs as they learn to write and represent;
*   consider the use of appropriate formative assessment tools to assess your studentsâ€™ development in writing and representing;
*   design and undertake an inquiry, and;
*   lead others in learning about writing and representing.

### Programme Structure

You can look forward to:

*   a half-day orientation session to prepare you for SWI;
*   a ten-day programme with a blend of in-person and online synchronous and asynchronous learning sessions; and
<img src="/images/programme%20structure%203.png" style="width:70%">
		 
*   four post-SWI sessions to support your application of learning from SWI. These sessions will be held once a term between Term 4, 2023 and Term 3, 2024. You will be given the opportunity to co-construct and present your inquiry into the teaching, learning and assessment of writing and representing through collaborative professional conversations. You will also consider the implications of your inquiry on your classroom practice and leadership.

### Who may Apply
EL Key Personnel (KP), Teacher Leaders (TLs) and potential KP/TLs in primary and secondary schools are invited to apply. Applicants should be in a position to influence teaching and learning in their schools.

  

Those who participate will:

*   commit to deepening their understanding of writing and representing processes and be willing to explore their own pedagogical practices;
*   be willing to write and talk about their own practices of writing and representing;
*   be reflective, enthusiastic and open to receiving feedback on their writing and representing as well as to giving feedback to others;
*   commit to applying what they have learnt in their own classrooms;
*   demonstrate teacher leadership by influencing their peers as well as their students to write and represent more effectively; and
*   contribute to Special Interest Groups (SIGs)\*&nbsp;as members of the SWI alumni

  
*&nbsp;SIGs are groups of like-minded teachers who share a passion and work together to develop a valuable repertoire of ideas and practices.

### How to Apply
