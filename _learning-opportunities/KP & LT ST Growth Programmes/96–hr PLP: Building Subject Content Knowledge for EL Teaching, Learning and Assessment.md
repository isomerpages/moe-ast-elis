### Overview
The 96-hour Professional Learning Programme (96-hr PLP) is for EL KP, TLs and experienced EL teachers without specialisation in EL. This programme aims at enabling participants to become aware of the importance of deepening their Subject Content Knowledge (SCK) in the six areas of language learning in order to teach EL more effectively. The building of SCK is important for EL KP, TLs and experienced EL teachers who play a critical role in mentoring and leading other teachers in the practice of effective EL teaching. The programme is co-facilitated by PMTTs and MTTs in ELIS and tutors in the English Language and Literature Academic Group of the National Institute of Education (NIE).
### Learning Goals

As EL KP, TLs or experienced teachers without English specialisation, you will build foundational understanding of the SCK you need to teach EL effectively.
