<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>The 96-hour Professional Learning Programme (96-hr PLP) is for EL KP,
TLs and experienced EL teachers without specialisation in EL. This programme
aims at enabling participants to become aware of the importance of deepening
their Subject Content Knowledge (SCK) in the six areas of language learning
in order to teach EL more effectively. The building of SCK is important
for EL KP, TLs and experienced EL teachers who play a critical role in
mentoring and leading other teachers in the practice of effective EL teaching.
The programme is co-facilitated by PMTTs and MTTs in ELIS and tutors in
the English Language and Literature Academic Group of the National Institute
of Education (NIE).</p>
<h3>Learning Goals</h3>
<p>As EL KP, TLs or experienced teachers without English specialisation,
you will build foundational understanding of the SCK you need to teach
EL effectively.</p>
