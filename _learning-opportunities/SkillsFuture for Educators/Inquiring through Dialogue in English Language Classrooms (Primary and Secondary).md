<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>In the SFEd courses on Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL) to enable students
to become inquirers who explore, discover, make real-world connections
and problem-solve in EL Classrooms, you will:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>actively inquire into:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>your enactment of IBL which incorporates the practice of Inquiry through
Dialogue (ItD) in the teaching, learning and assessment of EL, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>your practice of leading others in their learning about IBL and the practice
of ItD; and</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply your learning and reflect on your practice, which includes the use
of educational technology to promote active student learning in participatory,
connected and reflective classrooms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are courses at three Levels of Practice that you can choose from:</p>
