<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Inquiry-based Learning (IBL) enables students to become inquirers who
explore, discover, make real-world connections, and problem-solve in EL
classrooms. In the SFEd courses on IBL, you will:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>actively inquire into:
<br>− your enactment of IBL which incorporates the practice of Inquiry through
Dialogue (ItD) in the teaching, learning and assessment of EL, or
<br>−your practice of leading others in their learning about IBL and the practice
of ItD; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply your learning and reflect on your practice, which includes the use
of EdTech, to promote active student learning in participatory, connected
and reflective classrooms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can take this course at an appropriate Level of Practice:</p>

<p>To decide on the most appropriate Level of Practice to meet your learning
needs, please refer to the information for each of the three Levels of
Practice below.</p>
<h3>Levels of Practice and Learning Goals</h3>
<p><strong>Proficient</strong>&nbsp;Level of Practice: Does independently</p>
<p><em>Select this course at the Proficient Level of Practice if you:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>wish to have fundamental understanding of the practice of IBL including
ItD, and would like to become skilful and independent in your practice
of IBL in EL classrooms;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would like to be able to, on an ongoing basis, reflect on your practice
of IBL including ItD to improve student learning of EL; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan to apply your learning as you participate in the course.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Goals</h4>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>demonstrate understanding of IBL including ItD and its rationale in the
teaching, learning and assessment of EL;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>apply the principles of EL teaching and learning (CLLIPS) and EL teaching
processes (ACoLADE) to support the practice of IBL including ItD; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>make appropriate choices, including the use of EdTech, to support the
practice of IBL including ItD, based on knowledge of learners, the EL Syllabus
2020 and the EL curriculum.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Accomplished</strong>&nbsp;Level of Practice: Adapts skilfully</p>
<p><em>Select this course at the Accomplished Level of Practice if you:</em>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>are skilful and independent in your practice of IBL including ItD in the
teaching, learning and assessment of EL;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>would like to become adaptive in your practice of IBL including ItD, by
being able to customise learning for your students as you enact your EL
lessons; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan to apply and, on an ongoing basis, reflect on your learning as you
participate in the course, which involves reviewing a lesson for adaptive
practice of IBL including ItD in EL classrooms.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>Learning Goals</h4>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>customise EL lessons, incorporating the use of EdTech, that support the
practice of IBL including ItD based on:
<br>− principles of EL teaching and learning (CLLIPS) and teaching processes
(ACoLADE), and
<br>− knowledge of learners, acquired through sound use of assessment information
on students’ learning readiness, interests and learning profiles, collected
before, during and after instruction; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>demonstrate adaptiveness in enacting IBL including ItD through prompting,
posing questions, and supporting the collaborative process by which students
learn the skills and learner strategies in the areas of language learning.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p><strong>Leading</strong>&nbsp;Level of Practice: Leads others effectively</p>

</ul>
<h4>Learning Goals</h4>
<p>By the end of this course, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lead and mentor peers/teachers in the practice of IBL including ItD in
the areas of language learning, by demonstrating:
<br>− the application of principles of EL teaching and learning (CLLIPS),
EL teaching processes (ACoLADE) and e-pedagogy
<br>− ongoing review of and critical inquiry into the practice of IBL including
ItD, and
<br>− adaptiveness in the practice of IBL including ItD to customise learning
for students in the EL classroom; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>plan with the aim of facilitating professional learning about IBL including
