*   actively inquire into:

	*   your enactment of IBL which incorporates the practice of Inquiry through Dialogue (ItD) in the teaching, learning and assessment of (EL), or
	*   your practice of leading others in their learning about IBL and the practice of ItD; and

*  apply your learning and reflect on your practice, which includes the use of educational technology to promote active student learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.
