### Overview


In the SFEd courses on Inquiry-Based Learning (IBL), you will:

*   actively inquire into:

*   your practice of IBL as a teacher of English Language (EL), or
*   your practice of leading others in their learning about IBL as leaders in the teaching, learning and assessment of EL at the secondary level; and

*   learn together with other participants to apply your learning and reflect on your practice, which includes the use of technology to promote active student learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.

There are courses at three Levels of Practice that you can choose from:
