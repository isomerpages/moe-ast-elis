*   actively inquire into:

	*   your enactment of IBL which incorporates the practice of Inquiry through Dialogue (ItD) in the teaching, learning and assessment of (EL), or
	*   your practice of leading others in their learning about IBL and the practice of ItD; and

*  apply your learning and reflect on your practice, which includes the use of educational technology to promote active student learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.

There are courses at three Levels of Practice that you can choose from:

* knowledge of learners, acquired through sound use of assessment information on students’ learning readiness, interests and learning profiles, collected before, during and after instruction; and

*   demonstrate adaptiveness in enacting IBL including ItD through prompting, posing questions, and supporting the collaborative process by which students learn the skills and learner strategies in the areas of language learning.
