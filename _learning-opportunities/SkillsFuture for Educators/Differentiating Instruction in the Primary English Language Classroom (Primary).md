	*   your practice of leading others in their learning about IBL as leaders in the teaching, learning and assessment of EL at the primary level; and

*   learn together with other participants to apply your learning and reflect on your practice, which includes the use of technology to promote active student learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.
