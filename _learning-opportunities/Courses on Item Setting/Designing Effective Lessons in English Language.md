<em>How can I design English Language (EL) lessons that are aligned with both the EL Syllabus 2020 and the Singapore Teaching Practice (STP)? What considerations should I take into account when selecting a teaching approach and strategies to enable my students to achieve the lesson objectives?</em>

### Overview

In this Singapore Teaching Practice-Professional Learning Module (STP-PLM), you will learn to design and develop learning experiences for students to attain the Learning Outcomes in the EL Syllabus 2020 by drawing on the relevant Teaching Areas and Teaching Actions in the STP.

### Learning Goals

By the end of the four sessions of this module, you will be able to apply the STP teaching considerations and Teaching Actions to design effective EL lessons through:

*   establishing learner and learning outcomes in the six areas of language learning for a unit of work;
*   determining lesson objectives and planning key questions;
*   sequencing and organising learning;
*   evaluating, selecting, adapting and/or creating instructional materials and learning resources; and
*   setting meaningful assignments to monitor, reinforce and extend student learning, and to support self-directed learning.
