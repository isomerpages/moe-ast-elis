### Nurturing Creative, Critical and Purposeful Writers

<em>How do I support my students to develop a positive disposition towards writing and representing? How do I enable them to write creatively and critically for a variety of purposes, audiences, contexts and cultures? What do I need to do to plan and teach engaging and effective writing lessons that meet my students’ readiness to learn, interests and learning profiles? How can I teach writing and representing effectively, including in blended learning contexts?</em>

### Overview

This learning programme aims to provide you with a deeper understanding of the processes of writing and representing. You will have opportunities to explore, practise and reflect on how to teach writing and representing. You will consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.

### Learning Goals
By the end of this learning programme, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of writing as a complex cognitive, linguistic and social process;
*   scaffold the learning of writing and representing to meet students’ readiness to learn, interests and learning profiles;
*   teach students the skills and learner strategies for writing and representing creatively and critically, exploring word choice and grammar with an awareness of purpose, audience, context and culture using a range of print, non-print and digital networked learning resources; and
