<h3>Getting Students Hooked on Reading</h3>
<p>Why do my students not improve in their reading comprehension and vocabulary
despite the many reading lessons in class? How would a habit of wide and
extensive reading and viewing address this problem? What can my school
and I put in place to support students to develop and reap the benefits
of a reading habit, including in blended learning contexts?</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This learning programme aims to enable you to plan, enact and review a
programme for extensive reading and viewing. You will consider ways to
use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active
learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will
learn how to motivate your students to read and view independently and
with others for enjoyment.</p>
