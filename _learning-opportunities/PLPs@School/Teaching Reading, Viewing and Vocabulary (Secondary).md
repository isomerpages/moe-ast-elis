### More than Meets the Eye&nbsp;

<em>How can I enable my students to read and view print and digital texts more effectively and with discernment? How do I teach them a repertoire of reading, viewing and vocabulary learner strategies for use, including in blended learning contexts? What appropriate tasks and tools can I use to assess my students’ skills and learner strategies in reading, viewing and vocabulary development?</em>

### Overview

This learning programme aims to provide you with a deeper understanding of the processes in close and critical reading, viewing and vocabulary development. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach and assess reading, viewing and vocabulary development. You will consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. The intended outcomes are for students to become inquiring and discerning readers and viewers.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this learning programme, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the theories and psycholinguistic processes of reading, viewing and vocabulary development;
*   employ a range of approaches, underpinned by the theories and principles, to teach and support the cognitive and metacognitive processes for reading, viewing and vocabulary development through the use of print and digital texts; and
*   use formative assessment tasks and tools to monitor students’ development of learner strategies and skills for reading and viewing, and vocabulary, to enable them to become inquiring and discerning readers and viewers.
