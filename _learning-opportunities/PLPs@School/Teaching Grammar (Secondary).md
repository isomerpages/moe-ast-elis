### Meaningfully Right

What are my personal beliefs about teaching grammar? How do I enable my students to acquire the learner strategies they need to be confident about their use of grammar for effective communication? Which grammatical items and structures should I focus on when my students make so many grammatical errors? How can I teach grammar effectively, including in blended learning contexts?

### Overview
This learning programme aims to provide you with a deeper understanding of grammar and the approaches to teaching it so that the learning of grammar is meaningful to students. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach grammar. You will consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable your students to use their knowledge of grammar to read effectively and with discernment, and use grammar accurately and appropriately to create a wide range of texts for various purposes.

### Learning Goals
By the end of this learning programme, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of grammar and the principles of teaching grammar;
*   apply the principles of teaching grammar to design EL lessons that enable students to refine their grammatical knowledge and learner strategies for the purposeful use of language, and to achieve the intended learning outcomes;
*   select appropriate teaching approaches and design learning experiences, in alignment with the EL Syllabus 2020, to enable students to learn grammar through inquiry and use grammar accurately and appropriately when speaking, writing and representing for various purposes; and
*   formatively assess students’ use of grammar in order to enable them to read with discernment and communicate empathetically and effectively.
