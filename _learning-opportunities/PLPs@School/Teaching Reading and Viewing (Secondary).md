<h3>More than Meets the Eye&nbsp;</h3>
<p><em>How can I enable my students to read and view print and digital texts more effectively and with discernment? How do I teach them a repertoire of reading and viewing learner strategies for use, including in blended learning contexts? What appropriate tasks and tools can I use to assess my students’ skills and learner strategies in reading and viewing?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This learning programme aims to provide you with an understanding of the
processes in close and critical reading and viewing to address the diverse
needs of learners in your EL classrooms. You will be able to apply your
understanding to teach and assess reading and viewing more effectively
in integration with the other areas of language learning. You will consider
ways to use EdTech, including AI, in blended learning contexts to support
active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.
The intended outcomes are for students to become inquiring and discerning
readers and viewers.</p>
