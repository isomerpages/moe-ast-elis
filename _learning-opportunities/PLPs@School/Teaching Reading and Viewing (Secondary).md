<h3>More than Meets the Eye&nbsp;</h3>
<p><em>How can I enable my students to read and view print and digital texts more effectively and with discernment? How do I teach them a repertoire of reading, viewing and vocabulary learner strategies for use, including in blended learning contexts? What appropriate tasks and tools can I use to assess my students’ skills and learner strategies in reading, viewing and vocabulary development?</em>
