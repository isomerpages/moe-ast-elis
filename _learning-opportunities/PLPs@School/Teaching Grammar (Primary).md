<h3>Right from the Start</h3>
<p><em>What is grammar? How do I enable my students to see the value of learning grammar and its application in real-world contexts? What teaching approaches and learner strategies would enable my students to learn to use grammar meaningfully and in context? How can I teach grammar effectively, including in blended learning contexts?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This learning programme aims to provide you with an understanding of the
‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of teaching grammar. You will be able to apply
the approaches and processes of teaching grammar. You will consider ways
to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active
learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will
also learn about how to enable your students to apply their knowledge of
grammar to become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative
inquirers.</p>
