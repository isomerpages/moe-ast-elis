### Right from the Start

<em>What is grammar? How do I enable my students to see the value of learning grammar and its application in real-world contexts? What teaching approaches and learner strategies would enable my students to learn to use grammar meaningfully and in context? How can I teach grammar effectively, including in blended learning contexts?</em>

### Overview

This learning programme aims to provide you with an understanding of the ‘what’, ‘why’ and ‘how’ of teaching grammar. You will be able to apply the approaches and processes of teaching grammar. You will consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn about how to enable your students to apply their knowledge of grammar to become empathetic communicators, discerning readers and creative inquirers.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this learning programme, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of grammar and the principles of teaching grammar;
*   apply the principles of teaching grammar, using a whole-part-whole approach, to enable students to develop grammatical knowledge and learner strategies for the purposeful use of language;
*   design appropriate and relevant learning experiences, in alignment with the English Language Syllabus 2020, to enable students to learn grammar through inquiry while considering their readiness to learn, interests and learning profiles; and
*   formatively assess students’ use of grammar to help them become discerning readers, empathetic communicators and creative inquirers.
