### Reading and Viewing between the Lines

<em>What learner strategies do my students need to strengthen their reading and vocabulary? How can I use various teaching approaches, including in blended learning contexts, to enable my students to become effective and discerning readers and viewers?</em>

### Overview

This learning programme aims to provide you with an understanding of the processes in close and critical reading, viewing and vocabulary development. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach and assess reading, viewing and vocabulary development. You will consider ways to use educational technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. The intended outcomes are for students to become inquiring and discerning readers and viewers.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this&nbsp;learning programme&nbsp;, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate knowledge and understanding of the theories and psycholinguistic processes of reading, viewing and vocabulary development;
*   employ a range of approaches, underpinned by the theories and principles, to teach and support the cognitive and metacognitive processes for reading, viewing and vocabulary development through the use of print and digital texts; and
*   use formative assessment tasks and tools to monitor students’ development of reading and viewing skills and vocabulary, to enable them to read and view as creative inquirers, and discerning readers and viewers.
