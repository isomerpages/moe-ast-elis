<h3>Reading and Viewing between the Lines</h3>
<p><em>What learner strategies do my students need to strengthen their reading and viewing? How can I use various teaching approaches, including in blended learning contexts, to enable my students to become effective and discerning readers and viewers?</em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This learning programme aims to provide you with an understanding of the
processes in close and critical reading and viewing to address the diverse
needs of learners in your EL classrooms. You will be able to apply your
understanding to teach and assess reading and viewing more effectively
in integration with the other areas of language learning. You will consider
ways to use EdTech, including AI, in blended learning contexts to support
active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms.
The intended outcomes are for students to become inquiring and discerning
readers and viewers.</p>
