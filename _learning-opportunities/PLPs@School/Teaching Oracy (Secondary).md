<h3>Growing Inquirers through Dialogue</h3>
<p><em>What are ways I can teach my students the use of learner strategies and skills to improve oral communication and classroom interaction? How can I encourage student collaboration and knowledge construction through purposeful exploratory talk? What are the learner strategies in the areas of listening and viewing, speaking and representing, and oral interaction that my students should acquire to be empathetic  communicators, discerning listeners and viewers as well as creative inquirers? How can I teach oracy effectively, including in blended learning contexts? </em>
</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This learning programme aims to provide you with a deeper understanding
of the processes of listening and viewing, and speaking and representing
to address the diverse needs of learners in your EL classrooms. You will
be able to apply the knowledge of spoken grammar and vocabulary to teach
and assess pronunciation, prosodic features and oral interaction skills
more effectively in integration with the other areas of language learning.
You will consider ways to use EdTech, including AI, in blended learning
contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective
classrooms.&nbsp;You will also learn how to use multimodal texts to teach
oral communication skills.</p>
