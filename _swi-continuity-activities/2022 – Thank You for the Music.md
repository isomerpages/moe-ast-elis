Throughout history, music has been used to express emotions, beliefs, and identities. It is a powerful communicative tool that allows people from all walks of life to connect beyond borders, and as ABBA so succinctly encapsulated in their lyrics, “Who can live without it \[music\]… What would life be? Without a song or a dance, what are we?”. In the 2022 SWI Online Writing Marathon, music was a source of inspiration for our alumni. Using music as a stimulus for writing, our alumni penned their personal responses to their chosen pieces. In sixty minutes, participants delved into their experiences, navigated the memories they triggered and reflected on the impact music has had on their lives. This culminated in the sharing of their creations and a collective feeling of gratefulness for the role music plays in their lives.

Linked by hearts  
Cares depart  
Wonderous melodies  
Souls a-sparked   
  
Kindred spirits  
Beautified  
Shared in  
fine design



### *   Letter from Joseph

Life is full of colours if we choose to look at it that way 

Into a magical world and be far from dismay 

The real world may be harsh at times, needless to say

But be comforted and stay enthralled each day

Thank You for the Music

The strings that linger

Filling my heart with gratitude

Staying alive, staying alive!

My help cometh from the Lord

Who neither slumbers nor sleeps

The sun shall not smite me by day

Nor the moon by night

I can be the lady in red

Painting the town today

Celebrating the breath of life.

Singing another chorus

And sharing your song!

Thank You, You’re My Music!



### *   To My Beloved Sister-In-Law

_"Going back to the corner where I first saw you, Gonna camp in my sleeping bag I'm not gonna move”_  
(The Script, 2008, track 4)  
  
4th August 2020. Almost two years since you left.  
  
We first met in Jakarta and were fast friends. You became family and life was whole. Then, it was painfully ripped apart.  
  
Which corner can I possibly go back to, to meet you?   
  
In my memory, I see you at the corner of the sofa, laughing, no, guffawing at something you read on Facebook. I see you remarking in your typical easy-going manner telling everyone _'Seb’_, a slang in your language that the family learnt to mean 'Don't worry, I got it'. I see you smiling at me from the doorway where we last said goodbye, not knowing that would be the last time.

It's been a while since I went to church  
I'm not moving  
Tell me what's wrong.  
  
A friend rekindled that conversation of spirituality with me when I was serving my stay-home-notice in 2020. She had food delivered to the residence I was staying at and did her best to lift my spirits.  
  
My help cometh from the Lord  
The Lord is thy shade  
He shall preserve thy soul  
  
It's just you and me.  
  
A more recent event – my mother-in-law's cancer – made me rethink my priorities and question my purpose in life. I took out the bible and placed it beside my bed.  
  
I'm not moving  
Tell me what's wrong.  
  
It's where I want to be.
