Throughout history, music has been used to express emotions, beliefs, and identities. It is a powerful communicative tool that allows people from all walks of life to connect beyond borders, and as ABBA so succinctly encapsulated in their lyrics, “Who can live without it \[music\]… What would life be? Without a song or a dance, what are we?”. In the 2022 SWI Online Writing Marathon, music was a source of inspiration for our alumni. Using music as a stimulus for writing, our alumni penned their personal responses to their chosen pieces. In sixty minutes, participants delved into their experiences, navigated the memories they triggered and reflected on the impact music has had on their lives. This culminated in the sharing of their creations and a collective feeling of gratefulness for the role music plays in their lives.
