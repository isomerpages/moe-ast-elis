<p><strong>I remember you … I forget you …</strong>
<br><em>By Jessica Teo</em>
<br>
<br>I did not know you but you knew you
<br>How unfair! Right from the beginning
<br>
<br>I remembered you as I was watching the sun bursting and
<br>waning with eternal glory
<br>
<br>Closer than a friend, you led me round the clock, not missing one single
step
<br>
<br>I forgot you as I darted from house to the car; from storefronts to deadlines</p>
<p>Silent, you lingered like a shadow at my heels, knowing I would trip over
you&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I remembered you in my mistake, desperately searching for a way out in
a mirror
<br>
<br>Gently, you met me on a winding road, affording me your patience
<br>
<br>I forgot you in a warm embrace, a hand held tight, a laughter long-lasting
<br>
<br>Like wind, you slipped through my fingers, restless, untamed, unreachable
<br>
<br>I remembered you when breaths turned short, miserably short&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>Desperately, I chased after your fading steps, yearning to pour my regrets
into you
<br>
<br>I forgot you as strength returned,&nbsp;soothing strength, energising
strength
<br>
<br>With the temper of a drummer, I charged myself to recontour the shape
of my life
<br>
<br>I remembered you in a room charged with calls, screens, stress, and meeting
notes
<br>
<br>Still drowned with cares, I knew better, that I’d lose you in a millisecond&nbsp;</p>
<p>I forgot you. I forgot you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In all the fleeting moments, the longest lasting moments, I forgot you.&nbsp;
<br>
<br>I knew you, why did you turn away?!&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wait … wait … right to the end …</p>
<p>
