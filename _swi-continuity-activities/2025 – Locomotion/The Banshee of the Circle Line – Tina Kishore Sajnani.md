<p><strong>The Banshee of the Circle Line</strong>
<br><em>By Tina Kishore Sajnani</em>
<br><strong><br></strong>Banished to a realm
<br>deep within the ground,
<br>she growls and roars
<br>as she prowls in the dark.
<br>At every opportunity the pregnant banshee</p>
<p>lifts her wail
<br>her shrill shrieking escalating …
<br>
<br>She is silenced at every juncture
<br>Smooth silvery voices
<br>programmed to recite ad nauseum
<br>in so many tongues the ear cannot help
<br>but listen.
<br>
<br>She remains unheard, out-tuned,
<br>the eyes of her carriage consumed by screens,
<br>heads bowed, not in awe but in
<br>oblivion.
<br>
<br>Still she screams – birthing
<br>many children yet carrying ever more.
<br>She has been mother for 15 years
<br>Her bridal veil still streaming past
<br>streaked with red.
<br>
<br>Her path is true and fast
<br>but when will her way find light?
<br>She surges on through her labyrinth
<br>unlike her sisters
<br>who touch both the earth and sky.</p>
<p>
