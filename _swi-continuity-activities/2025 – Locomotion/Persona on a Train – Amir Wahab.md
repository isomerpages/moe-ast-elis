<p><strong>Persona on a Train</strong>
<br><em>By Amir Wahab</em>
</p>
<p>What’s your persona on a train?
<br>
<br>Are you the mum juggling a pram with newborn infant screaming for attention
and son swinging from the handrail, keeping calm and smiling to pacify
a shrieking child?</p>
<p>Are you the zoned-out student staring vacantly into the distance, headphones
flashing the colours of the rainbow, while you listen to the noises in
your head, noises that others cannot hear and take you inward?</p>
<p>It’s NOT a living room, but a public space shared with others!</p>
<p>Are you the lounge lizard settling into your living room sofa with legs
crossed, chatting through the clatter of rumbling tracks and announcements?</p>
<p>What’s your persona on a train?</p>
<p>
