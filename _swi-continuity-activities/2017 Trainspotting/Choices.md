### Choices

By Rachel Goh

Doors are closing …

Happy energetic voices break the usual silence in the MRT cabin  <br>
The other commuters were still glued to their screens, unperturbed  <br>
Looking up, I see a group of young people, the studious kind, bespectacled, in T-shirt and jeans, talking excitedly, oblivious to those listening in  <br>
I wondered where they were from, the head-start they must have had in life  <br>
Talking about university courses of choice …  <br>
Discussing scholarship options …  <br>
Comparing interview preparations …  <br>
Their voices filled with hope, excitement, and anticipation  
Must be tough choices when the world is their oyster

Next station, Kent Ridge

The choices we have in life, however many or few,  <br>
Are freeing, opens up many possibilities  <br>
The decisions we choose to make  <br>
Are at the same time trapping, closing doors to other opportunities  <br>
The path we each must take  <br>
Is a calling, defining our purpose, demanding our time and talents

The train approaching platform B will end its service at the next station.

Coming to the end of a journey  <br>
Regretting what could have been  <br>
Accepting what is  <br>
Realising that no matter what paths we take, all will have to give an account at the final destination
