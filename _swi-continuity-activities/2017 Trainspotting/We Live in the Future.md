We live in the future  <br>
Because “The Best Is Yet To Be!”  <br>
“Auspicium Melioris Aevi!”  <br>
Chant the leaders of our great nation  <br>
For that is what they learnt  <br>
Together with their ABCs  <br>
And so the people strive  <br>
Towards a better future  <br>
A future that taxes our minds  <br>
Robs our hearts  <br>
And corrupts our souls  <br>
In the hopes of a better job  <br>
A fuller wallet  <br>
And a seaview 99-year  <br>
Shoebox in the sky  <br>
That will house our future  <br>
Their books and their diplomas  <br>
So that they can continue  <br>
This journey  <br>
Into the future  <br>
A bright and better future  <br>
For us all to inhabit<br>

 * Auspicium Melioris Aevi – meaning “hope of a better age”
