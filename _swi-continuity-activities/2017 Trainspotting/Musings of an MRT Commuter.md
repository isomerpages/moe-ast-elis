### Musings of an MRT Commuter

By Davina

<p><center>Ding Dong!<br>
Doors are closing <br>
Dooo dooo dooo <br>
Please do not lean against the doors. <br> 
Please stand to the left. <br> 
Give way.</center></p>

<p><center>Constant signs and sounds remind us what to do<br> 
How we should behave<br> 
How we should stand<br> 
How we should be considerate</center></p>

<p><center>Nobody is paying attention<br> 
Leave me alone<br> 
I need to shut out the noise<br> 
Let me listen to my music<br> 
Let me watch my You Tube videos.</center></p>

<p><center>Enough of reminders<br> 
I know how to behave<br> 
Do you know how to behave?<br> <br> 
Stop telling me what to do<br> 
And what not to do</center></p>

<p><center>I need to be still<br>
I need to focus<br> 
Despite the constant stimulation<br> 
I manage to find<br> 
My quiet space<br> 
My quiet time<br> 
As the whirring sounds of the track<br> 
Fad into the background…</center></p>

<p><center>Doo dook…doo dook…doo dook…</center></p>
