*Doors are closing*  

The usual frenzy accompanied by that announcement was starkly absent. A clinical zing wafted into my nostrils as my usually dilated pupils stabilised. I was spoilt for choice. The paradox of the converse was mind-boggling. Lost. The paralysis of indecision arose within, as if seeking to suffocate my air passage.

*Next station: Kent Ridge*

The familiar feeling of anxiety halted its ascent as realisation dawned. There was no destination. No next stop that I was waiting for. The cool air-conditioning above my head ruffled my untainted baby hair. The friction from the conveyor belt of wheels racing along the track resounded deafeningly in the vacuumed silence. The shrill whistling of the brakes signalled the impending approach of the next station.

*Please mind the platform gap*

The aisle separating the 2 rows of passenger privilege seemed reminiscent of the parting of the Red Sea. Hushed whispers of random utterings reverberated in the chamber. Unabashed yawns of fatigue allowed access to the depths of darkness. Pairs of eyes were glued to the lit screens of instant gratification while digitised voices debated over functions and weather. Still, the deadpan expression of one seemed unrivalled. Swirling twin tornadoes bore their gaze s into mine, as if the window to my soul was welcoming to one and all.

*Please do not lean against the train doors*

A compadre. There was a strange sense of camaraderie in that instant. A leaning towards each other, as if the gulf between us was magically fading away. In that brief fleeting moment, everything ceased to matter. Like the aftermath of drinking the flavoured tea of forgetfulness served by dear 孟婆, all was forgotten. Even the lingering lament of loneliness ceased its song.

A miracle.
