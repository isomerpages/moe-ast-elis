### Small Stuff
By Adibah Abbas

Who notices?

The blips. The signs. The colours. The words.

Not the adolescent boys, who co-exist in their own virtual worlds,  <br>
Not the pretty young lady who made a beeline for the reserved seat  <br>
Not the old man clinging on to the pole bar.

Who notices?

“Please do not lean against the train door”  <br>
The symbols on the door.  <br>
The green arrows and the little man running to the right.  <br>
The $500 dollars in red.  <br>
The missing full-stops in the LCD displays that announce your destinations.<br>

The windows that divide the 7 seats,  <br>
The speckled marbled floor,  <br>
The linear maps in 8 distinct colours and  
6 hand bars in a set.

7 beeps before the door closes.  <br>
The hums and the screeches of the wheels on the tracks  
The whoosh of the pressure gauge that opens and closes the doors.

Who notices?

Perhaps that day…  <br>
The group that sits and stares and glances and glares.

With pen in hand, they skim and scan every inch of the place  <br>
With new eyes  <br>
With tingling nerves  <br>
Finding joy in looking and seeing the small things.
