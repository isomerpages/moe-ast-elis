### Never a Day Without A Line

By David Ng

This line is filled with sounds of nature.  <br>
This line is searching.   <br>
This line is excited. 

That line greets and welcome.   <br>
That line sees the unseen.   <br>
That line sees something disturbing, sad.   <br>
That line is casual.   <br>
That line protects.   <br>
That line minds (the gap).

This line is carefree.   <br>
This line is tired, "phew!"

That line smells a familiar smell from Novena.   <br>
That line minds the pronunciation.   <br>
That line encourages.   <br>
That line waits. 

This line waits.   <br>
This line is interrupted.   <br>
This line replies.   <br>
This line is distracted (by two Korean beauties).

That line launches!

<u>A Special Journey</u>

My journey felt free. We are strange sight. How often do you see commuters with a pen in hand? Yet, no one notices!

My observations of commuters tellsÂ of being trapped. They are all trapped in their gadgets. It had to take one Green Ranger to pull their gazes away from the screens. Couples, groups enter the carriage but no conversations take place. Strangers, they seem to be.

<u>Haw Par Villa</u>

Set on a hill  <br>
A definitive site  <br>
Weathered countless  <br>
Reconstructions and renovations  <br>
To maintain the heritage  <br>
Whilst all around  <br>
Changes constantly confounds.

Brothers would be pleased  <br>
To rest in  <br>
The knowledge that  <br>
Heritage and community  <br>
Building is still  <br>
Esteemed and important  <br>
For this generation  <br>
Still finding its way.
