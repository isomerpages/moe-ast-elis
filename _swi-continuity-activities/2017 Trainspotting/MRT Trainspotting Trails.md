### MRT Trainspotting Trails


by Cynthia Yow Ee-Linn (ST EL).

<p><center>Seng Kang Secondary School.<br>
What do you see?<br>
Eyes glued to the screen.<br>
Fingers go tap, tap, TAP!<br>
No, scroll up! Yes, scroll down now!<br>
Quick swipe left. Then swipe right.<br>
A triumphant smile flashes and another game level conquered.<br>
What do you see?<br>
Eyes firmly closed.<br>
Body swaying gently left to right.<br>
Wake up! Wake up!<br>
Please give up the red-coloured reserved seat.<br>
There’s someone who needs it more than you.<br>
What do you see?<br>
Eyes are on each other.<br>
Let’s stand near the vertical pole next to the train doors.<br>
They exchange their stories.<br>
With beaming smiles on their faces, they laugh.<br>
Singapore’s happiness index must be going up.<br>
What do you see?<br>
Eyes are wide open and staring at the destination board.<br>
The red light is blinking.<br>
Train doors open in unison.<br>
Botanic Gardens! Please mind the platform gap.<br>
	My destination beckons me. </center></p>
