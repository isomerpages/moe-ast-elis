The Singapore Writing Marathon was held on 13 April 2017, organised as part of the extension activities for SWI Alumni from 2014, 2015 and 2016. A cosy number of eight teachers turned up for the Writing Marathon. We kept the element of surprise alive for our alumni by building on the idea of Trainspotting which originated from the British phenomenon of train geeks waiting on train platforms, notebooks in hand, but instead of recording the numbers of trains coming into the station, the writing marathoners recorded their sensory experiences of travelling in trains and around train stations. As we hopped in and off trains and wandered around the stations, there was a stark realisation of how much of our existence is passed off as mundane and ordinary when in reality it is rich and overflowing with sounds, smells, sights, tastes and textures unique to a place and time. The writing took us to unchartered territories which we shared proudly and unabashedly with the rest though it was still in its infancy. It brought back memories of the time we spent at the SWI retreat.

Although not comedic like its Hollywood namesake, Trainspotting: Singapore Writing Marathon 2017 stayed true to its underlying themes of exploration of the hidden and unexpected. Of nature, of journeying, of the world around us. It drew three generations of alumni of the Singapore Writing Institute united by a passion to write.

Armed with our writing journals, programmes and poems on train journeys past and present, near and far we were excited to take off from the Labrador Park Station.
