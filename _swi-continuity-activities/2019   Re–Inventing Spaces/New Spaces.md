### New Spaces

by Joanne Lee

Keong Siak Road

Historic streetscape of 2-storey shophouses

Visited by war

Aged floral tiles and sagged stairs

Battered and tired

The atmosphere changed!

Beauty restored, repurposed and rejuvenated

Its charm ensuing

Towering blocks at the background not withstanding

Reinvented

Keong Siak Bakery

Where old flavours meet the new

A refreshing stop

Attap chee cheesecake and nasi lemak pizza

A refreshing thought…

New spaces in my life

Experiences and challenges

Restore

Repurpose

Reinvent
