The SWI alumni from the class of 2014 to 2019 met for a Writing Marathon at the Keong Saik enclave on 18 March 2019. It was a nostalgic afternoon of recalling the hive of activity that the Keong Saik neighbourhood was famous for. As we walked along the streets and explored the various places, we could not help but notice how the spaces have been re-invented to bring the traditional and modern seamlessly together. It was a great afternoon for the alumni who spent time taking in the sights and sounds, and expressing our thoughts through our writing pieces.
