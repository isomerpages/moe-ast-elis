### The Clean-Up

Both the Singapore River and Keong Saik Road have undergone a clean-up, a characteristically Singaporean undertaking by the government. The difference is that the Singapore River went through a drastic physical overhaul of sights and smells while, in the case of Keong Saik Road, it is a clean-up of its past reputation. This reputation overhaul is thanks largely to the efforts of the Urban Redevelopment Authority in the 1990s. As such, boutique hotels, offices, swanky eateries, hipster cafes have sprung up while in the past, it was a well-known red light haunt.

While the Singapore River is referred to as an ‘old lady’ by Lee Tzu Pheng in her poem, the same can’t be said of Keong Saik Road. Keong Saik Road was a place occupied by all kinds of ladies, both young and old. References to its lurid past are kept alive by tell-all narratives brilliantly written in the book ‘17A Keong Saik Road’ and also seen on the walls of Keong Saik Bakery.

As I reflect on the history of both our Singapore River and Keong Saik Road, I am grateful that   
Singapore has come out of her squalid poverty to what it is today. But now we have other problems as alluded to by Lee Tzu Pheng-‘We have become so health-conscious the heart can sometimes be troublesome’. The clean-up was designed to give Singapore River a new lease of life. It did!

Can the same be said of Keong Saik Road today? Inventiveness is the name of the game today. Whether each establishment can survive or sustain itself depends on its ability to constantly reinvent itself. I was surprised to learn, as a Singaporean, that Keong Saik Road had been named by the Lonely Planet as the 4th must-visit destination in Asia! Imagine that! The outcome of the clean-up and the draw of its past history appeals to travellers and hopefully, innovative and enterprising businesses.  
  
Comparing Singapore River with Keong Saik Road, I think the ‘heart’ of Keong Saik Road is still there. Its transformation mirrors the transformation of our nation. I would like to believe that in our efforts to reinvent ourselves, we will never lose heart but we will allow the eyes of our heart to see with compassion, goodness and love that we may write new narratives of hope for the world we live in.
