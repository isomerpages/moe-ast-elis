### Reinventing Spaces
By Emily Wong

It used to be attap seed in ice kacang   <br>
Held gingerly in frozen hands <br>
Now it’s in a dainty rose cheesecake <br>
Set exquisitely on a pretty plate <br>
Attap seed cheesecake with rose essence <br>
Exudes an ‘atas-sedikit’* elegance <br>
Coupled with the coffee fragrance

The luxury of a lazy afternoon <br>
Cozily nestled in an old new café <br>
Birthed one year ten months ago <br>
The creamy aromatic local coffee <br>
Served in a new way - <br>
Reinvention <br>
What a way to go!
