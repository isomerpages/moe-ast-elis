### The Same Reinvented


By Serene Lai

Same, but not quite the same. <br>
Shophouses and worn out spaces <br>
repackaged as sleek secret hotels<br>
to take cover from the glare of the outside world.

Similar only. <br>
Chinese food in Chinatown. <br>
Mala Hotpot. Pan-fried dumplings. <br>
Chinese. But not quite the Chinese we know of.

Familiar, yet disconcerting. <br>
Yanti Authentic Nasir Padang welcomes you, <br>
你好，要吃什么？ <br>
“Our curries alone make a good meal.”

But maybe the same after all. <br>
Good counsel from buddies about life’s challenges over Nasi Padang, <br>
washed down with F&N Soda and finally rounding it up with a good puff. <br>
“Ok Bro, next time.”

The meal becomes complete.
