### Re-Invention (1)

By Kervin Tang

A thousand miles travelled leaving your home and family, 

to seek a brighter future on this barren island south of China.

  

An arduous journey in a wooden junk that took many lonely nights,

over dangerous seas and in less than ideal conditions,

to be sold as coolies, giving up your freedom and dignity.

  

Relying on brute strength, you carried bales of rubber, pulled rickshaws and built homes. 

  

A thousand miles travelled leaving your home and family,

to this financial centre of the world where today millions are traded, won and lost in a day.

  

The world is your oyster; you go to the highest bidder for your skills.

  

Relying on your intellect and creativity, your ideas and thoughts contributed to our economy.

  

Be it bare-back under the hot sun or in a suit and tie at Raffles Place, you left your mark in this place I call home. As Singapore celebrates her bicentennial, this is a timely reminder to appreciate the talents you brought and sacrifices you made to make this a better place for all of us.
