### Jewel 'Unjeweled'

by Jessica Teo-Kang

Adorned with significance, the glory of your wee past

Your charm remains to this day

Inviting but aloof

Like a jewel, tucked in a corner of this tiny island

Having traversed time, you are named after the prominent

Your lowly districts

Given to promiscuous occupations

How the weak bowed to the strong

In all fairness, your heritage preserved

Your stories slightly perished

Your hope of glory continues

As we live to re-invent them ourselves…
