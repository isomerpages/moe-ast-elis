### Re-Invention (2)

By Kervin Tang

As I was seated outside Keong Saik Bakery sipping a cup of kopi susu and writing my piece on ‘Re-invention’, I noticed a business sign that hung above my head. It was by a company called “Focus Music”. Apparently, the unit situated above the bakery was occupied by a music academy. A quick check on Google revealed some activities undertaken by the academy. Besides the usual lessons on playing musical instruments, the academy also manages artistes and offers singing lessons.

In the current fad of reality programmes where the hottest singing sensations are unearthed, there are many who want to be the next Kelly Clarkson and JJ Lin. It is no surprise that this academy could the first stop for many teenagers who want to make a career in show business. This is the place where dreams are nurtured. Talented artistes also anticipate their next engagement or project that could catapult them to stardom.

  

As I proceeded to the next stop, I heard Teochew opera being sung from the second floor of a row of shophouses. Coincidentally, it was diagonally opposite Focus Music. The music came from a Chinese clan: 中山会馆 (“Zhongshan Huiguan”). Another quick check on Google showed that the Chinese clan was established in 1821! Chinese clans were set up by Chinese immigrants that came from a common province in China. Early objectives of the clans were to establish social network and provide links to their home province for members. Nowadays, clans are generally frequented by older folks who just want to while away their time.

Although situated across each other, the observations I made of the two organisations provide some interesting insights to today’s theme of “Re-invention”.

Music provided a common attraction for members of both organisations to congregate, notwithstanding the fact the music genre was totally different. Music at Focus offers hope to members with an eye to future stardom. Music at Zhongshan brings back memories of yesteryears as members reminiscent about their past. While I did not enter either premises, I could imagine the walls of the Chinese clan lined with pictures and stories of its glorious past. The walls at Focus could be filled with photos and newspaper clipping of students who were in the mass media.


Two organisations located along Keong Saik Road and both sharing a common love for music. As needs changed, the profile of members evolved and society progressed, both organisations offer a snapshot of the timeless charm that Keong Saik Road has to offer.
