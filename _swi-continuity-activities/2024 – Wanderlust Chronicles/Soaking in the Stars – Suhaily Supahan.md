<p><strong>Soaking in the Stars</strong>

<p><strong>Tekapo, New Zealand</strong>. I have never seen so many stars
in the night sky. I think any Singaporean would say the same thing. There
were bright sparkly stars, fizzling ones and baby ones that look like powder
strewn across the sky and frozen in place.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Now, that is Orion’s belt,” the guide said, pointing his finger at the
sky. I wondered, which stars exactly? I thought, oh no. Am I going to go
through this 1.5 hour tour (and a pricey one I insisted on at that) and
still not have any clear knowledge about these dazzling celestial objects
I see above me? Then, as if he heard my lament, the guide whipped out his
laser pointer. I gasped at the clarity of the strong green line pointed
straight at the stars that make up Orion’s belt. Ah, now I see.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So, why does the belt belong to Orion? Who is Orion? Why was he wearing
a belt? Again, the guide seemed to have heard my thoughts. With his handy
laser pointer, he showed the outline of Orion, almost like those connect-the-numbered-dots
puzzles I enjoyed as a kid. My eyes followed the lines he drew in the dark
sky as I soaked in all the details narrated by the guide. Yes, the belt
belonged to Orion, who is a hunter as he also had an arrow…</p>
<p>For another hour, my family and I learnt more about the stars. All the
questions we had about spotting stars versus planets versus meteorites
versus satellites in the sky were answered because we were able to see
the differences in how they moved that very night. How different the learning
was, rather than just watching a documentary or reading from the Internet.</p>
<p>After that hour of soaking in all the learning, we adjourned to a different
kind of soaking. Laying on a float in the hot pool, we listened to the
guide as he told us more. I forgot a lot of what he said because the only
thought I had in my head then was, wow, this is heaven.</p>
