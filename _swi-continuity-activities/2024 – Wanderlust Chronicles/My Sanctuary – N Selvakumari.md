<p><strong>My Sanctuary&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By N Selvakumari</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>My sanctuary, where love abides
<br>A haven from the world outside
<br>Where roles and responsibilities reside
<br>Teacher, friend, wife, sister, daughter, mother, I abide.
<br>
</p>
<p>With every lesson I spark and ignite
<br>Young minds and hearts with curiosity in sight
<br>I fuel the fire of wisdom, fan the flames of understanding high
<br>And pray that by the end of the day my energy levels fly high!</p>
<p></p>
<p>A friend, I stand through thick and thin
<br>A loyal companion all set to win
<br>Shared laughter amidst dried up tears
<br>A bond of trust through all the years.</p>
<p></p>
<p>With every smile and every tear
<br>My love and care banishes all they fear
<br>I am the rock that stands strong and true
<br>With superhuman strength I am but the glue.
<br>
</p>
<p>Date night beckons with a romantic glow
<br>But exhaustion looms and I don't know how to go!
<br>A glass of wine a quiet night
<br>Seems like a dream out of sight!
<br>
</p>
<p>A sister, I'm stuck with a special glue
<br>A bond of sibling love that's strong and true
<br>We've battled over outfits and pilfered each other's style
<br>But despite the chaos our love prevails with a smile!</p>
<p></p>
<p>As a daughter, I honour and respect
<br>The lessons I learn the love inspect
<br>From family ties a solid ground
<br>To roots that deepen, a story all around.&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Toys and books scattered everywhere&nbsp;
<br>It's a wonder I don't trip and pull my hair!
<br>Laughter and shouts of tiny feet fill the air&nbsp;
<br>I'm pretty sure I've lost my sanity but I don't care.
<br>
</p>
<p>Let the chaos rage and the children's laughter fill
<br>My sanctuary where love stands still
<br>A place of peace a haven of rest
<br>Where love and joy reside and my heart is blessed.</p>
<p>
