<p><strong>My Sanctuary&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p>By N Selvakumari</p>
<p></p>
<p>My sanctuary, where love abides</p>
<p>A haven from the world outside</p>
<p>Where roles and responsibilities reside</p>
<p>Teacher, friend, wife, sister, daughter, mother, I abide.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>With every lesson I spark and ignite</p>
<p>Young minds and hearts with curiosity in sight</p>
<p>I fuel the fire of wisdom, fan the flames of understanding high</p>
<p>And pray that by the end of the day my energy levels fly high!</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>A friend, I stand through thick and thin</p>
<p>A loyal companion all set to win</p>
<p>Shared laughter amidst dried up tears</p>
<p>A bond of trust through all the years.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>With every smile and every tear</p>
<p>My love and care banishes all they fear</p>
<p>I am the rock that stands strong and true</p>
<p>With superhuman strength I am but the glue.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Date night beckons with a romantic glow</p>
<p>But exhaustion looms and I don't know how to go!</p>
<p>A glass of wine a quiet night</p>
<p>Seems like a dream out of sight!</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>A sister, I'm stuck with a special glue</p>
<p>A bond of sibling love that's strong and true</p>
<p>We've battled over outfits and pilfered each other's style</p>
<p>But despite the chaos our love prevails with a smile!</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>As a daughter, I honour and respect</p>
<p>The lessons I learn the love inspect</p>
<p>From family ties a solid ground</p>
<p>To roots that deepen, a story all around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Toys and books scattered everywhere&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's a wonder I don't trip and pull my hair!</p>
<p>Laughter and shouts of tiny feet fill the air&nbsp;</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure I've lost my sanity but I don't care.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Let the chaos rage and the children's laughter fill</p>
<p>My sanctuary where love stands still</p>
<p>A place of peace a haven of rest</p>
<p>Where love and joy reside and my heart is blessed.</p>
<p>
