<p><strong>at the airport</strong>
</p>
<p>By Florence Lee</p>
<p></p>
<p>no one here will remember her</p>
<p>it is not true that</p>
<p>she can belong here</p>
<p>after all these years&nbsp;</p>
<p>nothing is holding her back</p>
<p>she is foolish to believe&nbsp;</p>
<p>this isn’t home</p>
<p>is she right to think</p>
<p>she deserves to, finally</p>
<p>embrace her own family</p>
<p>to reclaim her life for herself</p>
<p>to children who never felt her embrace&nbsp;</p>
<p>She is going back&nbsp;</p>
<p>to her own</p>
<p>to a home she has left behind</p>
<p>She is going home</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>(The poem can be read from bottom to top as well.)</em>
