<p><strong>at the airport</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Florence Lee</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>no one here will remember her
<br>it is not true that
<br>she can belong here
<br>after all these years&nbsp;
<br>nothing is holding her back
<br>she is foolish to believe&nbsp;
<br>this isn’t home
<br>is she right to think
<br>she deserves to, finally
<br>embrace her own family
<br>to reclaim her life for herself
<br>to children who never felt her embrace&nbsp;
<br>She is going back&nbsp;
<br>to her own
<br>to a home she has left behind
<br>She is going home</p>
<p></p>
<p><em>(The poem can be read from bottom to top as well.)</em>
