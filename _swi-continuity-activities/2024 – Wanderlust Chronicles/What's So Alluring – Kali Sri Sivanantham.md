<p><strong>What’s So Alluring</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Kali Sri Sivanantham</em>
<br>
</p>
<p>There’s something so alluring&nbsp;
<br>about You.
<br>Your grandeur and magnificence
<br>that bespeak your iconic features and charm.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your first waterfall
<br>a sprinkling rain shower in a rhythmic flow,
<br>soft and steady,
<br>befitting the times back in the days
<br>when locals and travellers stopped to pose and
<br>the people on the escalator in the background
<br>strutting in their denims, high-waisted or baggy,
<br>for the must-have snapshot.
<br>You were a buzzing global village,
<br>Your kampong spirit so strong.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The world was advancing — going green.&nbsp;
<br>You had to up your game!
<br>So, you got a facelift.
<br>Out with the old, in with the new
<br>Kinetic raindrops it became.
<br>The brass beauts rising and falling
<br>in a lulling but endless waltz,
<br>moving with the mundane, bustling times.
<br>Work was harmony. Harmony was work.
<br>
</p>
<p>With the earth, you kept rotating —&nbsp; you wouldn’t stop.
<br>You gotta keep abreast with the times.
<br>And the in-thing was sustainability.
<br>Plastic surgery was necessary.
<br>The outdoors brought indoors.
<br>Now, you are a sanctuary;&nbsp;
<br>a ‘concrete jungle’ in every sense.
<br>A sight to behold.&nbsp;
<br>Beneath the blue skies peeking&nbsp;
<br>through a kaleidoscopic glass dome,
<br>the rush of a mammoth shower&nbsp;
<br>cascading down into a manmade vortex.
<br>A resplendent selfie paradise&nbsp;
<br>for avid photographers and globetrotters.
<br>Water sloshing, you are a symphony,
<br>Your scent, sweet and subtle.
<br>You, bold and beautiful,&nbsp;
<br>powerful and tranquil,
<br>mimicking the spirited and self-nurturing Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
</p>
<p>Now, in a world of digital natives,
<br>You have to be trending
<br>And authentic too.
<br>No more cosmetic surgery;&nbsp;
<br>Just screen, high-tech no less
<br>But you are not YOU without your waterfalls,
<br>so you have become my Wonderfall.
<br>Vibing with a world that&nbsp;
<br>eased into remote working and blended learning.
<br>
</p>
<p>So much progress in mere decades.
<br>No wonder all speak so well of you.
<br>They say: You are the GOAT<sup>1</sup>.
<br>But do you know what makes you YOU?
<br>It’s the simplest of things that make you captivating.
<br>The faith of families huddled together in a prayer,
<br>The welcoming embrace and goodbye kisses,
<br>Sometimes a teardrop or two.
<br>Not forgetting your viewing gallery
<br>overlooking the vast expanse of blue,
<br>now and then,&nbsp;
<br>one of Man’s marvellous inventions soaring past.
<br>The handsome old school charm you evoke
<br>Teleporting me into a portal of nostalgia,
<br>and a feeling of home.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Your splendour and ambience
<br>that echo many wanderlust chronicles and memories.
<br>That, about You,
<br>is so alluring.</p>
<p></p>
