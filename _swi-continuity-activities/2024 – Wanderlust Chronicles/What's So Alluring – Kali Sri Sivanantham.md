<p><strong>What’s So Alluring</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Kali Sri Sivanantham</em>
<br>
</p>
<p>There’s something so alluring&nbsp;</p>
<p>about You.</p>
<p>Your grandeur and magnificence</p>
<p>that bespeak your iconic features and charm.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Your first waterfall</p>
<p>a sprinkling rain shower in a rhythmic flow,</p>
<p>soft and steady,</p>
<p>befitting the times back in the days</p>
<p>when locals and travellers stopped to pose and</p>
<p>the people on the escalator in the background</p>
<p>strutting in their denims, high-waisted or baggy,</p>
<p>for the must-have snapshot.</p>
<p>You were a buzzing global village,</p>
<p>Your kampong spirit so strong.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>The world was advancing — going green.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You had to up your game!</p>
<p>So, you got a facelift.</p>
<p>Out with the old, in with the new</p>
<p>Kinetic raindrops it became.</p>
<p>The brass beauts rising and falling</p>
<p>in a lulling but endless waltz,</p>
<p>moving with the mundane, bustling times.</p>
<p>Work was harmony. Harmony was work.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>With the earth, you kept rotating —&nbsp; you wouldn’t stop.</p>
<p>You gotta keep abreast with the times.</p>
<p>And the in-thing was sustainability.</p>
<p>Plastic surgery was necessary.</p>
<p>The outdoors brought indoors.</p>
<p>Now, you are a sanctuary;&nbsp;</p>
<p>a ‘concrete jungle’ in every sense.</p>
<p>A sight to behold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Beneath the blue skies peeking&nbsp;</p>
<p>through a kaleidoscopic glass dome,</p>
<p>the rush of a mammoth shower&nbsp;</p>
<p>cascading down into a manmade vortex.</p>
<p>A resplendent selfie paradise&nbsp;</p>
<p>for avid photographers and globetrotters.</p>
<p>Water sloshing, you are a symphony,</p>
<p>Your scent, sweet and subtle.</p>
<p>You, bold and beautiful,&nbsp;</p>
<p>powerful and tranquil,</p>
<p>mimicking the spirited and self-nurturing Singaporeans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Now, in a world of digital natives,</p>
<p>You have to be trending</p>
<p>And authentic too.</p>
<p>No more cosmetic surgery;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Just screen, high-tech no less</p>
<p>But you are not YOU without your waterfalls,</p>
<p>so you have become my Wonderfall.</p>
<p>Vibing with a world that&nbsp;</p>
<p>eased into remote working and blended learning.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>So much progress in mere decades.</p>
<p>No wonder all speak so well of you.</p>
<p>They say: You are the GOAT<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>But do you know what makes you YOU?</p>
<p>It’s the simplest of things that make you captivating.</p>
<p>The faith of families huddled together in a prayer,</p>
<p>The welcoming embrace and goodbye kisses,</p>
<p>Sometimes a teardrop or two.</p>
<p>Not forgetting your viewing gallery</p>
<p>overlooking the vast expanse of blue,</p>
<p>now and then,&nbsp;</p>
<p>one of Man’s marvellous inventions soaring past.</p>
<p>The handsome old school charm you evoke</p>
<p>Teleporting me into a portal of nostalgia,</p>
<p>and a feeling of home.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p>Your splendour and ambience</p>
<p>that echo many wanderlust chronicles and memories.</p>
<p>That, about You,</p>
<p>is so alluring.</p>
<p></p>
