<p>The Singapore Writing Institute (SWI) alumni spent an afternoon on 17
May 2024 in Changi Airport rediscovering themselves as writers. Co-facilitated
by SWI alumni Kali Sri d/o Sivanantham and N Selvakumari, the alumni immersed

of “Wanderlust Chronicles”, the alumni penned their thoughts and emotions,
allowing their imagination to flow.</p>
