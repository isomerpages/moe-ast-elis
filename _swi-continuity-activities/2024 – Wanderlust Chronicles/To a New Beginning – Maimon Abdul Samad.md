<p><strong>To a New Beginning</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Maimon Abdul Samad</em>
</p>
<p>Picking up her bag, looking ahead, she took one step at a time, slowly
but surely. She hesitated for a moment before turning to give a final wave
to those who took the time to send her off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>“Bye, Deanna!” she heard her sister yelling as she frantically waved to
her.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She wiped the tears that rolled down the corner of her eyes. She was glad
that no one close to her could see that. Not wanting to show her true feelings,
she never once shed tears in front of others. One has to put up a brave
front, no matter what - that’s her belief.&nbsp;</p>
<p>She quickened her steps to the boarding gate. With mixed emotions, she
showed her boarding pass. She walked straight to the plane, found her seat,
and made herself comfortable for the long haul. She told herself that a
new beginning awaited her. No more sad thoughts. As she looked out of the
window, somehow her mind drifted to her past, the one that she badly wanted
to leave behind. She hoped the new unfamiliar surroundings and new experiences
would fill her life with memories to revisit in her moments of silence.
Feeling comforted, she closed her eyes, and dozed off.&nbsp;</p>
