<p><strong>My Sanctuary (an acrostic poem)</strong>
</p>
<p>By Amos Sim Kah Heng
<br>
</p>
<p>Silence beckons
<br>Amos to
<br><em>Nua</em> (Hokkien for ‘lazing around’) on the red sofa
<br>“Click” goes the light switch as he
<br>Turns on the television and reaches for the remote
<br>Up… right… right… down…
<br>Ahh… this series… what about this one… Let’s continue with <em>Bridgerton</em>!
<br>Respite, rejuvenation, resuscitation
<br>Yup, my home, my sanctuary!&nbsp;</p>
