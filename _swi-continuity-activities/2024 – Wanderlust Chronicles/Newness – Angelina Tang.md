<p><strong>Newness</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Angelina Tang</em>
</p>
<p>Newness is a break, an “untanglement” from the previous, inviting a freshness
of perspective, so it feels born again, hopeful, full of possibilities.</p>
<p>This is how Changi Airport, Jewel, feels like.&nbsp; It feels new, understandably
so, for it has been built in 1981 - not without first starting site preparations
in 1975 by demolishing 558 buildings, exhuming 4096 graves and clearing
nearly 80 hectares of swampland - and then re-invented many many times
over, always new-er than before.&nbsp; The sense of renewal and progress
is always present.&nbsp; Over time, Swensens, the first restaurant at Changi
Airport in Terminal 1 in 1981, became a place more familiar to generations
past.&nbsp; What is new-er is featured in a long list in the airport’s
directory: Hoshino Coffee Japanese Cafe &amp; Restaurant; Putien; Luke’s
Lobster and of course, the obligatory Starbucks in Terminals 1, 2, 3 and
4.&nbsp; In time, these will, inevitably, become another Coffee Cafe &amp;
Restaurant, another specialty eatery and another chain cafe.</p>
<p>Every few years, we put on a fresh pair of lenses and witness Changi Airport
reincarnated, newer, more exciting, multi-faceted Jewel-like and yet, it
is the same ancient narrative of newness, of being born again, hopeful,
full of possibilities.</p>
<p>How new is new but to the receiver of the experience?</p>
