<p><strong>My Sanctuary&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Noraini Yosorh</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I yearn for holidays, the time to be free&nbsp;</p>
<p>Escaping work and the weight of household chores</p>
<p>Filling my time with things I enjoy</p>
<p>Living colourful dreams, my imagination soaring like moving pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visions from words transform into scenes</p>
<p>Creating vivid images in my mind&nbsp;</p>
<p>Cooking up a storm in the heart of my home</p>
<p>Tickling the taste buds of my family with new recipes</p>
<p>Reconnecting with friends, old and dear</p>
<p>Giving them the attention they deserve</p>
<p>Packing my bags for a journey afar&nbsp;</p>
<p>Exploring new places, guided by stars</p>
<p>Breathing fresh air, taking in new perspectives&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experiencing new things with loved ones</p>
<p>Strengthening the bond with those I hold close</p>
<p>Sharing moments that matter, where laughter flows</p>
<p>Cherishing the frivolous, without a care in the world</p>
<p>These moments are my sanctuary.</p>
