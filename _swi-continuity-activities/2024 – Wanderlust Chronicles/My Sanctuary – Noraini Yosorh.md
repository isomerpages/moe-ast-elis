<p><strong>My Sanctuary&nbsp;</strong>
</p>
<p><em>By Noraini Yosorh</em>
</p>
<p></p>
<p>I yearn for holidays, the time to be free&nbsp;
<br>Escaping work and the weight of household chores
<br>Filling my time with things I enjoy
<br>Living colourful dreams, my imagination soaring like moving pictures&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>Visions from words transform into scenes
<br>Creating vivid images in my mind&nbsp;
<br>Cooking up a storm in the heart of my home
<br>Tickling the taste buds of my family with new recipes
<br>Reconnecting with friends, old and dear
<br>Giving them the attention they deserve
<br>Packing my bags for a journey afar&nbsp;
<br>Exploring new places, guided by stars
<br>Breathing fresh air, taking in new perspectives&nbsp;
<br>Experiencing new things with loved ones
<br>Strengthening the bond with those I hold close
<br>Sharing moments that matter, where laughter flows
<br>Cherishing the frivolous, without a care in the world
<br>These moments are my sanctuary.</p>
