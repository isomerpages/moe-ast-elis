<p>My classroom, my sanctuary.</p>
<p>Potential arrives every morning, waiting to be unlocked.&nbsp; Some do
not know that they are the Potential.&nbsp; All they feel is that this
is a safe environment.&nbsp; Some do know that they are the Potential.&nbsp;
Like a chick taking its first flight, all they need is a nudge.&nbsp; Like
a lock on a treasure chest, all they need is&nbsp; a turn of a key, a ‘click’.
I welcome them all into my sanctuary, our sanctuary, and the day of learning
begins.</p>
<p>There are days the keys don’t work.&nbsp; Then, there are days Potential
unlocks potential.&nbsp; Growth takes place right here in the sanctuary.&nbsp;
Potential realised out there beyond the sanctuary.&nbsp; What a privilege
to witness it.&nbsp; What a responsibility to keep at it.&nbsp; Over the
years, I’ve realised that I don’t hold all the keys.</p>
<p>And there are days Potential goes missing.&nbsp; Absent, Non-Valid Reason.&nbsp;
What a waste!&nbsp; Because as much as they need the sanctuary, the sanctuary
is not complete without them.</p>
<p>Over the years, Potential re-connects and I’m always amazed at how my
nudging helped them take flight, how the turning of a key unlocked their
potential.&nbsp; I’ve played my part, an early part, but an important part.&nbsp;
A teacher, a surgeon (who treated my wife!), a musician, a dancer, a WTA
tennis player, a lawyer, a PHD holder and the list goes on.&nbsp; They
were all in my sanctuary and in the sanctuaries of many others who answered
the noble call to educate and nurture.</p>
<p>Our classroom, our sanctuary.</p>
