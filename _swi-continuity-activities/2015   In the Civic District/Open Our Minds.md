Images come knocking on the door of my mind during a leisurely stroll in the heart of the city. I see so many contrasts of the old and new. My camera comes alive and clicks away in all directions and angles capturing the sights around me. With an open mind, everything seems different to me. Suddenly, I become more observant and the city transforms from a dull grey concrete jungle to a kaleidoscope of colours with infinite possibilities and meaning.

A sense of wonder overwhelms me as I sit on a deck chair on the open roof deck of the Singapore Cricket Club which was established in 1852. I had just walked through rooms lined with paintings by Singapore artists who painted local scenes in the 1970s and 1980s, and cabinets filled with trophies that celebrated the club’s glorious sporting history. In my mind, I imagine patrons of the club, sipping wine or drinking beer and watching a cricket match taking place on the Padang or field in front of the club house. In contrast, now towering before me is Westin Stamford. It was completed in 1986 and it was the tallest hotel building in the world then. Hearing this fills me with pride that our little red dot is surging forward rapidly modernising and catching up with the rest of the world.

Yet before me, when I turn my head 45 degrees to my left, the stately and majestic City Hall comes into view. The tall columns and green dome transports me to the past. This building resembles buildings in Britain. This immediately connects me to Singapore’s colonial past. Singapore was once a British colony and the colonial masters had recreated a slice of home in Singapore. However, the old and new have now merged seamlessly into a wonderfully uniquely Singapore blend – where the old is preserved, respected and loved while the new is embraced and enjoyed by everyone living here.

As Singapore celebrates SG 50 - fifty years of independence, I am proud of what we have achieved so far as a nation. My deepest gratitude and appreciation for our founding fathers like Lee Kuan Yew, Toh Chin Chye, Goh Keng Swee, S. Rajaratnam and many other unsung heroes and heroines. My wish for Singapore is that we will remain a society that opens our minds to new knowledge and opportunities, while preserving our Singaporean culture and maintaining social peace and harmony. Indeed, I am looking forward in anticipation of our next fifty years together. Happy 50th birthday Singapore!
