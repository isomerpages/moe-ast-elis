### The Friday Before
By Emily Wong

As we trace our steps  <br>
Briskly walking through the Civic District  <br>
As we mingle with the crowd  <br>
Bearing witness to the pulsating city pace  <br>
As we ponder over the Old and the New  <br>
Taking in the non-fishy scent  <br>
Beside the Singapore River  <br>
Unlike the old filled with scum  <br>
The reminiscence of our past  <br>
Weighing against the present skyline <br> 
Ignite a thankful heart  <br>
Sending a deep appreciation  <br>
For the transformation  <br>
Touching us to the core  <br>
And the morning cumulates  <br>
To a page of potpourri mix

The Old and the Young  <br>
Old sites new additions  <br>
Same old self no doubt  <br>
Yet different within

Memories of old  <br>
Rekindling fresh insights  <br>
The grandeur of our past  <br>
A sense of National Pride

As our founding father  <br>
Lays ill in bed  <br>
The nation seems to divide  <br>
Whilst prayers are wrought  <br>
The unbelievable hoax surprised  <br>
Who would have guessed?  <br>
Such disrespect would abide  <br>
For a man who has toiled  <br>
All his adult life  <br>
To build a nation such as ours  <br>
The Old and the New  <br>
Will they ever meet?  <br>
I sigh

The river may be cleaned  <br>
Yet memories of old linger  <br>
The temple has stood the test of time  <br>
At the same place  <br>
For different devotees  <br>
Grandma used to frequent  <br>
The Seng Wong Beo Temple  <br>
At the corner of Tras Street  <br>
A chicken in her basket  <br>
Joss-sticks and incense papers  <br>
Offered to her gods  <br>
For the protection  <br>
Of her beloved family  <br>
Prosperity not excluded

Tasked to be a lookout  <br>
That the chicken remained  <br>
Safe on the plate at the altar  <br>
Owner unaltered

Grandma would offer her joss-sticks  <br>
Creating swirls of scenty smog  <br>
All around the temple ground  <br>
My eyes would water  <br>
As the stink of the smog  <br>
Meet the pair of little eyes

My reward for braving  <br>
The dimly lit corner  <br>
All by myself -  <br>
Was time spent  <br>
With grandma at the little shop  <br>
A pit stop for a quick bite  <br>
Of fried vegetarian beehoon  <br>
And peanut porridge

Now the reward  <br>
Is the lasting memories  <br>
I hold close to my heart
