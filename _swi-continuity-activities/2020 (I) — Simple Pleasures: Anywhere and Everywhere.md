Covid-19 saw the Writing Marathon going online for the first time on 14 March 2020 along with the launch of our SWI Alumni Facebook Group. From wherever our alumni were that bright Saturday morning of the Marathon, we took photographs of the places we were at, wrote about what we could see, smell, listen, taste and touch, and then posted them onto the FB Group’s page. Our inaugural online Writing Marathon started at 9.30 a.m., was supposed to end that evening, but to our delight, we had alumni still posting their simple pleasures right through to the next day!
