The online marathon borrowed its theme from Pam Allyn who says that reading is like breathing in and writing is like breathing out. Those who participated on 12 September were ready to read aloud the extracts of pieces of writing which had been individually chosen with love and then to respond in writing or representing to what was read. For the first time, the marathon was live-streamed to members of the Facebook SWI Alumni Group on FB so that those who were unable to participate on Zoom did not miss out!
