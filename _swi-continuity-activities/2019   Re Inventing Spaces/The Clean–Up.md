### The Clean-Up

By Martha John

I remember the Singapore River. You smelt it before you saw it and when you did see it, your senses were assaulted. I remember, as a young child, wanting to puke and run away at the same time, as the air was just thick with its unique stench. Looking at it now, you cannot imagine how bad it was then.
