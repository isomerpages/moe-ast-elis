### (UNTITLED)


by Adibah Abbas

  

My walk today <br>
took me back to Nenek’s old shophouse <br>
that now sits on prime real estate <br>
like that of Keong Saik Street.

  

All in the name of conservation, they say. <br>
Homes get re-zoned into commercial places.

  

Keep the façade. <br>
Retain the character <br>
Preserve the culture. <br>
All in the name of bringing in the tourist dollars.

  

But

  

How does that fancy sounding restaurant  <br>
or the atas-looking spa even capture the essence  <br>
of what used to be my playground?

  

The kaki lima* paved with fancy tiles <br>
hide the chalk dust of the teng-teng lines <br>
I used to draw.

  

The sturdy white grilles on the windows <br>
doubled up as monkey bars to amuse <br>
an overly-active child.

  

The colourful wooden rafters, now a decorative feature <br>
were the peep holes we flapped <br>
to watch for unwanted guests. <br>
The pretty swing doors offered privacy  <br>
While letting the wind in. <br>
No need for CCTVs and high-tech security alarms.

  

The high timber celings <br>
no longer hold the trapdoors with ladders <br>
that offer the escape routes my older cousins took <br>
when they wanted to go on a secret rendezvous.

  

At the end of Keong Saik Street… <br>
We see the Pinnacle <br>
That echoes the domes and minaret of the Sultan Mosque <br>
I saw in the distance from Nenek’s window.

  

I still hear Nenek’s voice,<br>
in the early hours of dawn. <br>
“Carilah menara gading.” Or <br>
Find your pinnacle of success in life.

  

Old places, new spaces, <br>
Perhaps they may make meaning to another generation after all.
