### The Working Capitol

Why would a can of Coke <br>
Cost three dollars <br>
When it’s only half a dollar <br>
When bought in a carton <br>
At the supermarket?

Reinvention!

The nostalgic quaint music <br>
Played retrospectively in the background… <br>
Every little thing that you do… <br>
Keeps getting better… <br>
I was dying inside…

Dying inside… <br>
To get better in all that I’m doing

How does one write the poignant   <br>
To stir in the readers <br>
To appreciate the past <br>
Not tinged with regrets <br>
But of hope and significance?

There is a need to move on <br>
With the writer’s craft

Reinvent the old with the new <br>
Build the same thirst for writing <br>
In the digital natives 

They say, a picture paints a thousand words <br>
Despite a thousand pictures out there <br>
Few words are actually spoken <br>
Though read on the palm of hands

We need to reinvent <br>
The old with the new <br>
The new with the old

It’s the same old Coke <br>
Albeit, a new price
