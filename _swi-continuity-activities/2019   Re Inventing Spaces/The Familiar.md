### The Familiar

This familiar little coffee shop stands out on this street of change.

The familiar tables and chairs lined up in neat rows, and fans whirring warm air onto the patrons sitting below, waiting in anticipation of the familiar.

The familiar being the smells emanating from the delicious array of foods covered in spicy hot chillies and flavours to melt the palate.  

The street changes, but the familiar remains.

The familiar lights shining bright on a hot sultry day.

The familiar cutlery of stainless steel standing in pots on ceremony, centre stage on faded brown tables inlaid with copper trimming.

The familiar tables darkened by stains from oily food, and water marks from glass tumblers long removed.

The familiar styrofoam boxes stacked tall for the take away yet to be served.

The familiar sound of clattering from the open kitchen at the back of the shop proclaiming loudly that the familiar will remain on the street of change.

The street where new restaurants and bars with posh sounding food, and clever new names proclaim a new beginning.

Who knows, maybe a new familiar set in motion?

Somehow, I think the old familiar of nasi padang will remain in the hearts much longer.
