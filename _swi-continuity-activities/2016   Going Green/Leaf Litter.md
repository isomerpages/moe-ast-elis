### Leaf Litter
By David Ng

The adornment of green moss itself  <br>
Gets covered by a leaf litter  <br>
Soon, the moisture gathers inwards

The outer pieces, dry and crisp, protect  <br>
The inner pieces give in to spores and filaments

Recycling starts in earnest.  <br>
Everything breaks down, but all is not lost  <br>
Because new life awaits  <br>
To use the very element of each piece.

The sunbeams break through the canopy  <br>
To enable life itself to break through.
