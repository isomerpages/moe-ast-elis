### The Crossing

By Adeline Lynn Teo

This mesmerizing symphonic melody that encapsulates the restless soul sweeps me over as I wander along this meandering pathway. I know not where it leads but I feel free! TRUST! I just trust that it will take me to Peaceful Paradise.

Soon. What awaits me needs no glare or stare. I am so glad I came. This Neverland so tranquil, so clear so unpretentious, and so real. This beautiful place masks the surreal world I sometime build around myself to keep alive. I need to breathe. I need to be calm. What is that I hear? Such beautiful tunes played by rustling leaves and cricket calls.

Listen! Do you hear? The harmonious concerto that be-stills this mystical moment. I keep time as it lulls me like a lullaby with each calming beat. I shut myself in this sweet jungle, this musical box. I hear the whispering trill so marvellously put together by the symphony of crickets and the song led by the choir of cicadas.

Although some might not agree with me that these blended sounds make music and may jolly well associate them with noise-making, or even describe them as jarring effects, they are to me connecting beats of the song in my head; a tune so fine, binding me to Mother Nature on this heavenly stroll of great discovery.

My heart jumpstarts each wakeful term. I pray whatever awaits me is delightful, for at times, I so wish to disembark. However, as I tread the bridge beneath me, I cross over, and feel the quietening of my anxious heart.
