### A Quiet Reflection

By Joanne Lee

Sitting quietly on a bench…   <br>
with a heart full of thanks,   <br>
and a notebook in hand,   <br>
on a Saturday morning.     
  
A gentle breeze …   <br>
rippling through a reflection of green,   <br>
dancing colours and mingling hues,   <br>
a fish kisses the surface and grins.       
  
Walking ahead…   <br>
sprouting roots supporting the tree,   <br>
nourishing it with nutrients,   <br>
keeping it upright as it inches up with glee.     
  
The fauna and the flora…   <br>
creating communities,   <br>
helping everyone in our midst,   <br>
to reach our destinies.
