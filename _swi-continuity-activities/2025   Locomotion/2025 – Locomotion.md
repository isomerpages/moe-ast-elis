<p>In the demanding rhythm of teachers’ daily lives, personal writing often
takes a backseat. The 2025 Writing Marathon: Locomotion, co-organised and
co-facilitated by Ms. Foo Soo Ling and Ms. Sandra Teng, offered a vital
opportunity as the Singapore Writing Institute (SWI) marked its 10th anniversary.
The SWI alumni embarked on a symbolic journey from Dhoby Ghaut MRT to Woodleigh
Village, their physical movement mirroring the path of discovery in the
writing process. Moving from place to place, participants drew inspiration
from their surroundings, be it the city's urban pulse or Woodleigh Village's
community spirit. This journey also prompted reflection on their dual identities
as teachers and writers.</p>
<p>Through guided writing exercises, participants explored their origins,
aspirations, and future directions. The day's significance lay not only
in the words they crafted but also in this profound realisation<strong>:</strong> when
teachers immerse themselves in writing, they develop deeper empathy for
their students' challenges and grow more skilful in nurturing young writers.
As the day concluded with heartfelt sharing sessions, these teacher-writers
emerged with renewed purpose, ready to inspire the next generation of writers
in their classrooms.</p>
