**Cheaters Never Prosper**

*I had a bird named Gale.    
Who was a male.   
I wish he wasn’t so pale.   
Coz then I’d put him up for sale!  *

This poem marked my first brush with Imposter Syndrome. At age 9 ½. It was a poetry assignment. And we all had to write a 4-line poem. This poem, which received high praise from my teacher and classmates, had in fact been written by my friend, Su. 

I wanted adulation of my own. So, I brought this poem home and passed it off as my own work to the OOHs and AHHs of my unsuspecting family. 

Strangely, the affirmation that I was so generously given did not give me the satisfying high I had expected to feel. I was perturbed. What I felt instead was an empty echoey sensation in the pit of my tummy that dragged me deep into a chasm of guilt and shame.

And I learnt that very day that accolades make you feel like a winner only if you’ve actually run the race. Because Cheaters Never Prosper.
