**To Be Free**

Freedom. Soaring high. What do these words mean to different people? What do these words mean to me at this stage of my life? They remind me of Grace Chua’s poem ‘Countdown.’ It is about a mother who is constantly on the run, fulfilling her tasks and shaping her identity through the roles she plays, yet longing to be somewhere beyond time’s gravity. That’s exactly me, I think. For a long time, I have wondered, when can I break free from the shackles of responsibilities, do things that I desire, learn things I had always wanted to learn and most importantly, enjoy the simple pleasures of life.

Then I ask my bundle of fur, a Golden Retriever, “What does freedom mean to you, Churros?” Last month, the four-year old underwent a knee surgery that capped his freedom to walk for the time being. Afraid that he might lick his wounds, he has been forced to wear an e-collar that limits his freedom to move elegantly. To him, freedom would be running after his buddies, pouncing on them and rolling on the grass, licking his mama’s face and jumping on the couch. Fortunately, in a month’s time the bandage and the e-collar will be removed, and Churros can run freely on the grass patch. No restrictions! That is his freedom to soar. 

For me, the tunnel is still long. Duties and responsibilities bind us and keep us steady on the road. Yet I believe when the time to soar comes, I will become the young child again, eager to discover new beginnings. 

Longing to be free or to soar isn’t easy if we don’t know how to soar or when our wings have been clipped over the years due to the responsibilities that tie us down. Yet, seeing the tenacity of my dog to try and bounce back to his energetic self despite his handicap teaches me to break free from the restrictions that I have imposed on myself. And for people like me, it is a matter of perseverance that we learn to soar or break free from the human clutches.
