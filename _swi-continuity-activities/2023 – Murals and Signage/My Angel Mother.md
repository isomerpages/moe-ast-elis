**My Angel Mother**

My mother’s passing in 2019 left an indelible mark on me. I had thought I would not be able to survive without my beloved mother as she was my closest confidante and my strongest pillar of strength.

However, with her passing, I learnt I had to be strong emotionally to fend for myself. I realised over time, I am not weak, instead I possess the inner strength to face the challenges of the future.

My mother is currently like an angel watching over me in heaven.

She is beaming at me and cheering me on as if she is saying, “Leng, you are stronger and braver than you think you are. With God, there’s nothing you can’t face or do in life!”
