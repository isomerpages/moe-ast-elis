# Rollin' Good Times

Wheels a rollin'  
Not the car  
Not the train  
I soar not from these   
I am but an atom in them  
Not in a place  
Nor a ship  
For I am an even smaller particle in these  

I soar  
Being my own engine  
Spinning revolutions      
Grinding watts  
Rollin' on a 180 dicut DT SWISS hub  
Wind on follicles of head and nostrils  
Nothing even comes close to this thrill  

I slow down because  
after a skipped  
beat  
my heart soars  
The Jeju-inspired lallang  
Calling me  
Like a rainbow  
The expanse of sea and ocean  
meeting  
And the heart soars even  
as the wheels   
roll to  
a  
stop  

I soar  
Rollin' on the hubs of good times  
I soared
