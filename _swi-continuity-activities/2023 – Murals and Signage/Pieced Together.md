**Pieced Together**

My life feels like a constant process of being broken into pieces and being put back together again; sort of like a fracture that heals – the breach becoming stronger for the breaking.

I never thought to survive my teenage years when my 'best friends' left me, or my university days when depression clung closer than a shadow. There have been worse storms since.

But somehow, each time, I was put back together, just that little bit stronger. I made new friends, found new joys and discovered new purpose.

Maybe I would never have been fit or ready for these new hellos and highs otherwise. Time will tell. But right now, I am grateful to be whole.
