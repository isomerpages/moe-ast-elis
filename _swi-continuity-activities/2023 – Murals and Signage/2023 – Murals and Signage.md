Meant to beautify public spaces or provide guidance, murals and signage, though ubiquitous, are often given little attention. Why you may ask? Simply because in today’s exhaustingly fast-paced world we do not have the time to pause and reflect. During the March holidays, a group of enthusiastic SWI alumni took the opportunity to take a breather, journey to the east and discover the colourful nooks and crannies of the Joo Chiat neighbourhood. The Writing Marathon, co-organised and co-facilitated by Arthur Kok, an alumnus of SWI 2018, provided an opportunity for our alumni to rediscover their love for writing. The welcoming sun, the unique signage and murals, and the selected read-aloud pieces were the perfect inspiration for all to write. The day ended with the reading of pieces that the alumni wrote.
