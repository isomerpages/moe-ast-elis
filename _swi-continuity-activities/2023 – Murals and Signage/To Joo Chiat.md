**To Joo Chiat**

Get the cat&nbsp;   
out of the bookstore   
Joo would never have guessed –&nbsp;   
traipsing, trading places   
snatches of conversations   
in a back alley    
that the footsteps    
make sense&nbsp;only if you are present.   
Step in the shade    
with philosophers, coffee, tea,    
giant cats and healing sunflowers    
mutt ado about nothing.
