Here is a compilation of reports written by ELIS Research Fund awardees, with the support of ELIS, on the findings from their research projects. The reports are evidence of what these teacher-researchers have achieved by expanding their understanding of student learning and developing their own skills in classroom research. The reports have been collated and sorted according to the print editions of the research reports. From April 2020, reports will only be published online.
