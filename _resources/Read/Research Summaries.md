The ELIS Research Team produces short summaries of books, journal articles, dissertations and other research reports that might be useful to teachers and researchers. This helps readers sort quickly through areas of interest, finding material that they can then follow up on in order to check the details.

Unfortunately, copyright regulations mean that we are unable to provide the original material. We suggest that, if you should find any summary particularly interesting, you may want to follow up on the original text.

Click [here](/files/Read@Academy%20-%20Online%20Resource%20User%20Guide%202020.pdf) for Read@Academy’s Online Resources User Guide to find their step-by-step guide for accessing their e-resources.  

The summaries are sorted under the headings below and you can click on an individual heading to see a full list of summaries under that heading.
