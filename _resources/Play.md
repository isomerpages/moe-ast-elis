The aim of the _Let’s Talk!_ card game is to motivate students to practise the communication skills needed for productive academic discussion in Mathematics, Science or the Humanities.

The cards illustrate ‘talk moves’ students can use to engage in discussion and, on the flip side, provide language scaffolds in the form of sentence stems to help them do this. Each sentence stem represents a specific “academic conversation skill”. (Zwiers & Crawford, 2011).
