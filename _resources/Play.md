<p>The aim of the&nbsp;<em>Let’s Talk!</em>&nbsp;card game is to motivate
students to practise the communication skills needed for productive academic
discussion in Mathematics, Science or the Humanities.</p>
<p>The cards illustrate ‘talk moves’ students can use to engage in discussion
and, on the flip side, provide language scaffolds in the form of sentence
stems to help them do this. Each sentence stem represents a specific “academic
conversation skill”. (Zwiers &amp; Crawford, 2011).
