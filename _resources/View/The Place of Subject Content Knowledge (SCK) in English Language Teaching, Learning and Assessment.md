<p>What is the place of Subject Content Knowledge (SCK) in the teaching, learning
and assessment of English Language?</p>
<p></p>
<p>In this video, we invite you to inquire into the following questions:</p>
<p>1) Why do we, as Key Personnel, Teacher Leaders and teachers, need SCK?</p>
<p>2) What is SCK and what counts as SCK for teaching, learning and assessment
of English Language?</p>
<p>3) How do SCK and Pedagogical Knowledge (PK) relate to each other? How
is Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK) realised?</p>
