Co-teaching is one form of support offered by ELIS to teachers who participate in our professional learning programmes. This video helps you understand how co-teaching with a Master Teacher helped one teacher learn how to apply Noticing as an approach to grammar instruction. Questions for you to think about while viewing the video:

1.  What aspects of your teaching would you like to further develop?
2.  How can co-teaching help you develop your practice as an EL teacher?
