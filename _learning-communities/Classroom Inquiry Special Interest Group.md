<p>A Special Interest Group (SIG) consists of like-minded teachers with a
similar passion, collaborating to develop a valuable repertoire of ideas,
practices and instructional resources. Any group of three or more teachers
can come together and form an SIG. Members of an SIG may be from the same
or different school. The SIGs are supported by MTTs/ EL, and Academy Officers
(AOs/ Pedagogy) from ELIS.</p>
<p>This video helps you understand better what a Special Interest Group is
and what you can expect if you want to set up an SIG. It highlights an
SIG’s passion to learn how to apply Marzano’s 6 Steps to Vocabulary Instruction
to help students.</p>
