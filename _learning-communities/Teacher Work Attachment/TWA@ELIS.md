ELlS provides Teacher Work Attachment opportunities where teachers can deepen their knowledge and expertise in their areas of need and interest.

Teachers can look forward to growing professionally through observing and being involved in a range of work ELlS does. They will be able to transfer their learning to the work in their schools to impact student learning.
