The Starter Writing Institute* was held over three weeks from 2 to 16 July 2014. Sixteen participants, including four Master Teachers from ELIS participated in the full-day sessions.  
  

Mr Roel Vivit, a Teacher Consultant for the Chicago Area Writing Project (CAWP) and the Director of Academics at Polaris Charter Academy was the lead facilitator. Mdm Varalackshmi Hariharan (MTT/ EL) and Dr Tay May Yin (Programme Director/ ELIS) led demonstration presentations to serve as role models for the group presentations that the participants would lead in at the conclusion of the Writing Institute. Mdm Vara, Dr Tay and the other Master Teachers provided guidance and support for the participants as they planned for their group presentations.

The learning experience involved participants in re-experiencing themselves as writers going through the writing process and applying learner strategies for teaching writing to develop and present on a writing instruction topic.

At the conclusion of the Starter Writing Institute, every participant submitted two final drafts of writing composed during the Institute. The participants also developed and co-presented a group demonstration of a writing lesson. In addition to direct daily contact in class, collaboration and communication took place in a wiki site set up for the Starter Writing Institute.  

\* The Starter Writing Institute has now been re-named the Singapore Writing Institute.
