<p>ELIS’s PLPs@School are designed for the Key Personnel (KP), Teacher Leaders
(TLs) and teachers in the EL Department of their school to deepen their
knowledge, skills and classroom practice in a selected area of language
learning. Supported by a Master Teacher, they also learn how their application
of e-Pedagogy and Blended Learning in the area of language learning can
be guided by sound understanding of the principles and processes of EL
teaching and learning.</p>
<p>The Master Teacher facilitating a PLP@School guides the EL KP, TLs and
teachers in their Professional Learning Teams (PLTs) through cycles of
learning, application, review and reflection over a year.&nbsp;In that
time, the Master Teacher also co-plans, co-teaches and co-reviews selected
lessons with PLT members, and provides guidance for the growth of teacher
leadership among them.&nbsp;</p>
