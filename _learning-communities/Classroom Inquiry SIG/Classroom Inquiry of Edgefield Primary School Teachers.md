<p><strong>Classroom Inquiry of Edgefield Primary School Teachers</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr David Ng is an alumnus of the <a href="https://elis.moe.edu.sg/elis/professional-learning/professional-learning-opportunities/courses-on-classroom-inquiry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Classroom Inquiry for English Language and Literature Teachers </a>(CIELL)
course. David teamed up with his colleagues, Ms Tan Pin Pin Joyce and Mrs
Manju Manoj, to inquire into how they could support their students who
were grappling with mixed-case letter identification</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dr Darren Nonis, Senior Academy Officer at ELIS, worked with David's team
to investigate how visual cue cards and the three-line writing template
might help students with mixed-case letter identification and handwriting.</p>
