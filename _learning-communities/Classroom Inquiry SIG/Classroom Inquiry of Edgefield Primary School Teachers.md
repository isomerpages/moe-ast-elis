<p><strong>Classroom Inquiry of Edgefield Primary School Teachers</strong>
</p>
<p>Mr David Ng is an alumnus of the <a href="https://elis.moe.edu.sg/elis/professional-learning/professional-learning-opportunities/courses-on-classroom-inquiry/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Classroom Inquiry for English Language and Literature Teachers </a>(CIELL)
course. Leading a dedicated team with Ms Tan Pin Pin Joyce and Mrs Manju
Manoj, they inquired into how they might support students grappling with
mixed-case letter identification.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Dr Darren Nonis, Senior Academy Officer at ELIS, worked with Mr David
Ng’s team to investigate how visual cue cards and the three-line writing
template might help students with mixed-case letter identification and
handwriting.</p>
