<em>What are adverbials? Why do students need to know how to use them? Can adverbials be placed anywhere in a sentence? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of adverbials and their connection with cohesion and coherence in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable your students to use their understanding of adverbials and their connection with cohesion and coherence to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent more effectively. To make your learning meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals
By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate understanding of adverbials and their connection with cohesion and coherence in the English Language Syllabus 2020;
*   apply your understanding to interpret your students’ questions and answers on adverbials, cohesion and coherence, teach the connection among them to your students, and explore the use of a variety of grammar references; and
*   explain how you will know when your students have used adverbials accurately and appropriately.
