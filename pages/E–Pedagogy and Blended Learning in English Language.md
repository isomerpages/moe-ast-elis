### Enabling Participatory, Connected and Reflective English Language Learning

 How can I harness educational technology effectively to foster active learning in a blend of in-person and online learning contexts in my EL classroom? What will I use to guide the design of my lessons, and the selection and use of educational technology tools in these contexts? How will I know if I have applied e-pedagogy and blended learning effectively in the teaching of EL?

### Overview

This learning programme aims to provide you with a deeper understanding of the practice of teaching with educational technology for active  learning in the EL classroom. You will be able to apply your understanding to create a participatory, connected and reflective classroom. You will learn to harness educational technology to design learning experiences and formative assessment that enable students to achieve the intended learning outcomes in blended learning contexts. You will also learn how to be guided by sound understanding of the principles of EL teaching and learning (CLLIPS) and EL teaching processes (ACoLADE) in your enactment of e-pedagogy and blended learning.
