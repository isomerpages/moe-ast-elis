<em>Why is it that my students can speak and write in grammatically accurate sentences using a variety of sentence structures, but they still do not always make sense? What are cohesion and coherence? Why do my students and I need to know and apply these concepts?</em>

### Overview
In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of cohesion and coherence in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable your students to use their understanding of cohesion and coherence to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent appropriately and more effectively. To make your learning meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.

### Learning Goals

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

*   demonstrate understanding of cohesion and coherence in the English Language Syllabus 2020;
*   apply your understanding to interpret your students’ questions and answers on cohesion and coherence, teach these concepts to your students, and explore the use of a variety of grammar references; and
*   explain how you will know when your students have applied cohesion and coherence appropriately and effectively.
