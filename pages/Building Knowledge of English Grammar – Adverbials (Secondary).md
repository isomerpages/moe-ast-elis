<em>What are adverbials? Why do students need to know how to use them? How are adverbials connected with cohesion and coherence in the English language? How can I explain this relationship accurately to my students? Why do all these questions matter to my students and me?</em>

### Overview

In this course, you will attain clearer understanding of adverbials and their connection with cohesion and coherence in the English language. You will be able to apply your understanding to teach these concepts accurately and effectively. You will consider ways to use technology in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory, connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable your students to use their understanding of adverbials and their connection with cohesion and coherence to listen, read, view, speak, write and represent appropriately and more effectively. To make your learning meaningful and relevant, you will have the opportunity to apply your understanding through analysing and responding to your students’ work.
