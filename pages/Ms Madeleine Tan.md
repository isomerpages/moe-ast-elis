<h3><strong>Ms Madeleine Tan</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Academy Officer/Pedagogy</strong>
</p>
<p>Before joining ELIS, Madeleine was a cross-level deployed Subject Head
of Assessment in a primary school. She began her teaching career in a secondary
school where she taught English Language and Social Studies. She subsequently
did a stint at MOE HR Recruitment Centre.</p>
<p>Madeleine is deeply passionate about assessment, specifically within the
context of student development, literacy, and heuristics. She believes
that deep learning often occurs beyond one's comfort zone and is interested
in carving out creative spaces for learning. Outside of work, Madeleine
enjoys making coffee (art) and experimenting with cooking recipes.</p>
