<h3>Meaningfully Right</h3>
<p>What are my personal beliefs about teaching grammar? How do I enable my
students to acquire the learner strategies they need to be confident about
their use of grammar for effective communication? Which grammatical items
and structures should I focus on when my students make so many grammatical
errors? How can I teach grammar effectively, including in blended learning
contexts?</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>This learning programme aims to provide you with a deeper understanding
of grammar and the approaches to teaching it so that the learning of grammar
is meaningful to students. You will be able to apply your understanding
to teach grammar. You will consider ways to use educational technology
in blended learning contexts to support active learning in participatory,
connected and reflective classrooms. You will also learn how to enable
your students to use their knowledge of grammar to read effectively and
with discernment, and use grammar accurately and appropriately to create
a wide range of texts for various purposes.</p>
